DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Antigenic variation is an immune-evasive, defensive strategy commonly exploited by many viruses. Antigenically variable viruses (AVV) are responsible for many human as well as veterinary diseases with high morbidity/mortality and significant economic losses worldwide. Viruses such as HIV-1, influenza virus and PRRSV (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus) are notorious examples and they epitomize the next level of scientific challenge that mankind faces in a fight against infectious diseases. Considering the enormity of the scientific challenges of antigenic variation, we believe more cross-disciplinary efforts mustbe made to share new advances in various scientific disciplines, exchange novel concepts, and to   
foster new collaborations between not only those who work on same viruses, but also among investigators who work on different viruses or different disciplines. In June 2014, we hosted the first Symposium on Vaccines Against Antigenically Variable Viruses (VAAVV). The symposium was well attended, which indicated (1) the uniqueness of the symposium, (2) scientific importance of the topic, and (3) significant need for the symposium to move the field forward. To continue the momentum, we are proposing to hold two additional symposia in 2015 and 2016. The major purpose of holding the symposia dedicated to developing VAAVV is to establish a strong network of investigators for conducting highly collaborative, integrative, and interdisciplinary research. This will establish the scientific foundation to develop novel strategis and make strides toward a long-term goal of producing efficacious and cost-effective vaccines against these viruses. We believe our symposium is unique in that it focuses primarily on the topic of antigenic variation, rather than a specific virus. To our knowledge, there are no comparable meetings that bring together investigators who work on different viruses focusing on this important topic. Considering the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations, the symposium will be proactive in facilitating interactions among participants by providing collaboration corners with dedicated time and spaces for attendees to have opportunities to interact directly with speakers. We will also arrange scientific speed dating among attendees to facilitate interactions and to foster collaborative research. In this Symposium, participants wil share, discuss and debate many problems associated with developing effective VAAVV, focusing especially on HIV-1, influenza virus and PRRSV. Many topics will be discussed including current understanding immune correlates of protection, new insights from computational-, structuraland systems-biology for rational immunogen design, and novel strategies for enhancing potency and breadth of immune responses. The specific Aim of the proposal is: To provide an effective venue that would allow sharing of state-of-the-art knowledge and exchange of innovative ideas that could facilitate interdisciplinary research and foster collaboration in order to overcome the problem of antigenic variation in vaccine development.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Obesity is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and is inversely associated with economic resources in
the US. Despite the well-documented correlation between decreased individual- and community-level eco-
nomic resources and increased obesity, few existing studies have been capable of attributing a causal impact
to the effect of economic resources on obesity, particularly among children. Determining the extent to which
economic resources are causal antecedents to weight-related health outcomes is vitally important for informing
structural approaches for improving population health. I am seeking the Pathway to Independence Award in
order to gain the additional training required to accomplish my career goal: to establish an independent pro-
gram of research that rigorously investigates socioeconomic inputs to health and productively bridges epidemi-
ology, nutrition, public health, economics, and social psychology. The training portion of this project includes
formal courses, directed readings, attendance of scholarly seminars, apprenticeships, and mentored career
building activities to gain skills in the following key areas: 1) economics and econometrics, 2) social psycho-
logical theories of SES-health relationships, 3) primary data collection and qualitative data analysis. The newly
acquired knowledge and skills will be applied in the research component of the project. The research compo-
nent of this project proposes a quasi-experimental approach to examine the extent to which increased eco-
nomic resources are associated with maternal weight gain and childhood obesity. I propose that the introduc-
tion of casino-style gaming to American Indian tribal lands offers a unique opportunity to determine how an ex-
ogenous, sustained influx of economic resources to American Indian communities impacts population health.
We will leverage existing geographically-linked vital records and school fitness testing records in combination
with space-time variation in casino openings in the state of California to accomplish the following specific aims:
1) Determine the extent to which an exogenous increase in economic resources affects: a) excessive gesta-
tional weight gain, b) large-for-gestational-age infant birth weight, and c) child obesity; 2) Assess how eco-
nomic resources stemming from casinos may affect weight-related health through the collection of formative,
qualitative data; 3) Collect quantitative data in order to assess mediating or moderating mechanisms between
exogenous economic resources and weight-related health. The training and research activities will feed into
publications and conference presentations, and will prepare me to compete successfully for R01 funding during
the R00 phase of the project.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This submission is a new application for the UCLA IDDRC, entitled UCLA Center for Translational Research in Neurodevelopment (UC-TRaN). The fundamental purpose of our Center is to provide an optimal environment for performing outstanding research into the causes, mechanisms, and treatments of intellectual and developmental disorders. The new leadership model in the center emphasizes collaborations among Center investigators, core personnel, and community partners, with support for research spanning basic research and clinical practice. Our aims are 1) to create cutting edge and cost effective infrastructure resources in facilities and personnel for IDD investigators; 2) to provide
integrated services within cores that support research from multidisciplinary teams and multiple levels of analysis; 3) to promote interactions between cores and among research investigators to promote collaborative, multidisciplinary and translational research, and 4) to create educational and outreach opportunities within the center, in collaboration with a West Coast Consortium of IDDRCs and community partners.  We propose five interacting cores: 1) Administration, Education and Outreach; 2) Genetics, Genomics and BioInformatics, which performs genetic analysis, sequencing, expression, and provides Big Data resources; 3) Cells, Circuits and Systems analysis, supporting electrophysiology, human iPSC and cerebral organoid culture development, and optogenetics; 4) Structural and Functional Visualization, which provides access to and analysis of imaging tools from miniaturized microscopes through animal and human MRI; and 5) Clinical Translation, supporting clinical trial development, recruitment, phenotyping across species, and collecting biosamples. The Center proposes an exciting model research project, Neurophysiological biomarkers of cognition in Dup15 syndrome: From mouse models to patients. Dup15q11.2-13.1 is associated with marked cognitive impairment and other symptoms of developmental delay. The study examines a novel EEG biomarker in a cohort of children with Dup15q and in two separate mouse models of Dup15q syndrome, one defined by an overexpression of a single gene, UBE3A, and the other from a full duplication of the region. In the animal model the project will test three mechanism-based pharmacologic treatments: d-serine, rapamycin, and a GABA-A ?5 receptor subunit inverse agonist, to determine whether these treatments change cell activation patterns and behavior. Together, the project and cores support our primary goal of optimizing outcomes of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities by promoting outstanding translational
research.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[CORE E: Abstract 
Despite an enormous increase in the basic science understanding of many IDDs, progress in 
the application of this basic knowledge in the clinic has been limited. The reasons for this gap in 
?translation? are many, but most agree that advances in defining, dissecting, and understanding 
the multiple dimensions of IDD phenotypes have lagged, with a few exceptions. A few examples 
are illustrative. Social functioning, an obvious and foundational element of adaptive ability and 
quality of life, is a natural target for intervention efforts across all IDDs, yet the field lacks 
suitable measurement tools that are well suited for application in clinical trials, and few 
measures have been rigorously compared to real world functioning for their precision and 
validity. Social measures often applied for diagnosis (Vineland Socialization or Communication 
subscales, ADOS, Social Responsiveness Scale-2, Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Social 
Withdrawal subscale [ABC-SW]) are either insensitive to change (too few items and limited 
range of scoring), too broad, too burdensome for repeated short-term use, too narrow, and/or 
vulnerable to expectancy bias. Even though the ABC-SW subscale has received a partial 
endorsement as a possible endpoint for capturing treatment effects on social behavior in Autism 
Spectrum Disorder (ASD)(and a separate modification likewise proposed for Fragile X 
Syndrome [FXS] trials), a review of its performance finds it vulnerable to placebo effects. 
Moreover, on closer inspection, the majority of the subscale's items are restricted to social 
interest alone, not capturing the many other possible social dimensions of interest. An objective 
of our Core is to continue our existing efforts to creatively increase study impact by developing 
and applying novel measurement approaches. An example was the substudy of McCracken and 
Kasari embedded in the NIMH Research Units on Pediatric Pharmacology (RUPP) Autism 
Network's Methylphenidate for the Treatment of Hyperactivity in Pervasive Developmental 
Disorder randomized clinical trial (RUPP Autism Network, 2005). Using an abbreviated (<10- 
minute scripted interaction repeated weekly) modification of the Early Social Communication 
Scales (ESCS), we documented the first example in the literature to our knowledge of a positive 
drug effect on core deficits of joint attention and emotion regulation in ASD.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the years since the completion of the human genome project, our ability to read the genome has improved tremendously. Frustratingly, our ability to interpret and comprehend what we can now easily read has lagged behind. Genetic variants that lie outside protein-coding regions are particularly challenging to interpret because the rules that govern their regulatory function are far less understood than the principles of protein- coding sequence. Addressing this challenge is particularly urgent because the drastic fall in whole genome sequencing costs will bring with it a wave of newly discovered non-coding and potentially causal variants. The recent completion of several genome-scale projects, and the release of pilot data from new and ongoing projects, have made it possible to begin building models whose goal is to predict the function of non-coding genetic variation. We propose the development of a brain-centric variant annotation framework that integrates temporal and spatial expression information from existing data sets, regulatory relationships established by eQTL studies, and chromatin state information uncovered by ENCODE and other studies, with the aim of providing, for any arbitrary input variant, an estimate of the magnitude of the effect, the systems or tissues most likely affected by the variant, and the stage of development at which the variant is most likely to produce a phenotype. Models will be trained on variants from whole genome sequencing studies of diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals. Development of this framework will proceed in three stages: 1) the above lines of genomic evidence will be combined with other features as predictors of enrichment for variants identified in individuals with diagnosed neuropsychiatric conditions, producing a score indicative of the variant's phenotype-shaping potential; 2) spatiotemporal gene expression matrices will be integrated to provide estimates of the tissues and time points most likely affected by variation at the non- coding query locus; 3) by combining the estimates produced in stages 1 and 2, we will create a single weighted context matrix that represents the individual's aggregate regulatory variant burden in space (i.e. brain tissue/region) and time. The framework will be demonstrated on previously unpublished variants in autism and bipolar disorder. The proposed framework would to our knowledge be the first non-coding variant annotation system that focuses on the effect on the brain, and is able to guide the user as to when and where the effects of potentially functional
variants are likely to emerge in an individual. A further novel aspect of the proposed system is that it will provide an integrated estimate of the overall burden context for an individual in spac and time. The proposed project will provide a valuable resource for scientists performing research in the genomics of psychiatric and neurological conditions. Perhaps more importantly, the lessons learned in the course of this project will provide the foundation for developing tools that may one day make interpreting non-coding variation in the clinic a reality.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Preclinical Models Core (PMC) supports IDDRC users who seek new treatments for IDD by
studying these disorders in 3 kinds of preclinical models: (1) Rodent models: This Core component
characterizes behaviors in mouse models of genetic or acquired disabilities. Measured behaviors include
learning, memory, social preference, ultrasonic vocalization, sleep and anxiety. (2) Stem cell models: This
Core component assists users to create disease models by generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
using standard reprogramming technologies or by genome editing, such as CRISPR-Cas, on established iPSC
lines. These cells, some derived from humans with IDD, afford a model in which to scrutinize cellular
consequences of genetic disease and to evaluate the efficacy of possible therapies. (3) Tissue culture models:
This Core component supports users to generate tissue culture models in which to study the development and
behavior of enriched or mixed populations of primary brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes,
oligodendroglia, microglia and endothelia. These cells originate in genetically manipulated rodents or they are
normal cells exposed to environmental stimuli, including drugs and toxins. The Tissue Culture Service and
Stem Cell Service interact closely, since they share several in vitro methodologies and serve as a conduit to
drive and help design rodent behavior testing.
The PMC emphasizes training of users and their staff. Trained users can continue studies in their own
laboratory or they can utilize the equipment in the PMC at reduced cost. This core interacts with others in the
Center. It will exchange protocols, services and best practices with other IDDRCs in the Network.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The PMC bridges all three domains of ?Genes, Brain, and Behavior?, the theme
of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC (see Overall: Overview of Center). The Core was developed in response to a user
survey (2014) that emphasized a need for an IDD-focused facility for the study of mammalian behavior and
one to address the potential of current stem cell technologies, including CRISPR-Cas.
Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to users at
other Centers in the Network.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a ssRNA (-) nairovirus that produces fever, prostration, and severe hemorrhages in humans. Fatality rates associated with CCHFV range from 5- 80% based on phylogenetic variation of the virus, transmission route, and different treatment facilities. Originally identified in Russia and he Congo, CCHFV has rapidly spread across large sections of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recently, U.S. citizen traffic has increased substantially to the regions endemic with CCHFV, specifically South Central Asia. As a result, there is a substantial risk for transmission of CCHFV and/or its tick vector to the United States. Intriguingly, CCHFV is not the only nairovirus that threatens the
public. Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDV) as well as nairoviruses Hazara, Dugbe and Erve can cause human disease of varying severity and economic distress. Currently, there is no vaccine or prophylactic available for treatment of CCHF or other any other nairovirus related diseases. Recent reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU) located within the nairovirus genome and implicated its possible involvement in down-regulation of the Interferon type 1 immune response through cleavage of post-translational modifying proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15). As a result, it has been suggested to be a virulence factor. This proposal will determine whether dual deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities are conserved functions of this subclass of proteases in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, these experiments will gain insight into their mechanism of recognition for Ub and ISG15 allowing greater predictability of currently unknown vOTUs. The proposal will also seek to evaluate a potential correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence of the nairoviruses in question. The resulting information will also provide critical insight into the role of vOTUs ply in viruses that may ultimately have practicality in the development of prophylactics targeting vOTUs.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV Rev protein is essential for viral replication and it functions to export unspliced viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. A key cellular co-factor for Rev is the CRM1 protein (also named XPO1). The mining of a database of human nuclear protein complexes led to the identification of two proteins that associate with CRM1-- RBM14 and PACS1. SiRNA depletions experiments revealed that both RBM14 and PACS1 are required for Rev activation of two different Rev-reporter plasmids, but not for reporter plasmids dependent upon the Constitutive Transport Element (CTE) or MMTV Rev RNA export pathways. Depletion of either protein reduces the level of unspliced viral RNA in the cytoplasm, but leads to an increase in unspliced viral RNA in the nucleus. The proposed research will investigate the mechanistic roles of RBM14 and PACS1 in Rev function. This research will provide mechanistic insight into HIV Rev function, and this may provide information leading to novel therapeutic strategies for HIV infection. Additionally, the proposed work is likely to shed insight into genera mechanisms of RNA export and this may have relevance to other human diseases.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[CORE C: Abstract 
The need for physiological assessments was generated by UC-TRaN faculty who required 
electrophysiological studies beyond collaborations. These electrophysiological assessments 
consisted of experiments performed in brain slices, acutely isolated neurons or in cultures, 
providing a functional analysis of changes in neurons, local circuits and microcircuits induced 
primarily by genetic alterations in cellular, mouse or rat models. The first objective of Core C will 
be to continue these analyses because the need remains and the Core will assist investigators 
with functional analysis at the cellular, circuit, and systems level using state-of-the-art 
electrophysiology and optogenetic recording methods in in vitro and in vivo preparations. 
Recent advances in both genomic and stem cell technologies, particularly hESC and hiPSC, 
have opened the door to new approaches in IDD research based on human cells. For example, 
cortical neurons harboring genetic mutations with a given disorder can in principle be readily 
produced from hiPSC generated from patients. A significant challenge remains to translate this 
promise into new discoveries about the basis of IDD and therapies. The second objective of this 
Core will be to facilitate this process by assisting UC-TRaN investigators to produce, propagate, 
and differentiate hESC and hiPSC into neural and glial cell types of interest to create in vitro 
models of IDD. Another function of the Core is to work with investigators and molecular 
screening resources available at UCLA to harness the potential of these in vitro models for drug 
discovery.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atherosclerotic vascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States with the majority of mortality due to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Risk factor modification such as reductions in hyperlipidemia constitutes the only treatment strategy available for this vexing disease. Thus, there is an active
effort to identify the culprit cellular processes that provide mechanistic insight. Recent reports f the proatherogenic phenotype of mice with a macrophage-specific autophagy deficiency has renewed interest in the role of the autophagy-lysosomal system in atherosclerosis. Lysosomes have the unique role of processing both exogenous material such as excess atherogenic lipids and endogenous cargo that includes dysfunctional proteins and organelles. Since little is known about the effect of an atherogenic environment on macrophage lysosomes, we aimed to test the notion that lysosomal dysfunction is the product of lipid metabolism and evaluate novel ways to ameliorate this effect. Our preliminary data demonstrate that macrophages develop features of lysosome dysfunction upon exposure to atherogenic lipids. In turn, this lysosomal stress can activate TFEB, the only known transcription factor that can broadly stimulate lysosomal biogenesis and function. The regulation of macrophage TFEB appears to be critically linked to mTOR signaling, buttressed by the observation that the classic mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin can induce lysosomal biogenesis while reducing macrophage dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Understanding the links between lipid metabolism and lysosomal biogenesis has important implications in understanding plaque progression. We propose to test the hypothesis that macrophage lysosomal biogenesis mediated by the transcription factor TFEB is an important compensatory response during atherosclerosis and serves an atheroprotective role. A variety of mouse models capable of dissecting the role of TFEB action in macrophages will serve as the research tools to address this hypothesis both in vitro and in vivo.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mature B-lymphocytes undergo class switch recombination (CSR), a deletional-recombination reaction that replaces the constant region of the immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule for one of a set of downstream constant region genes. This changes the class of the expressed antibody from IgM to IgG, IgE or IgA, each of which has distinct effector functions. CSR occurs within and requires large repetitive sequences termed switch (S) regions that precede the constant region genes. CSR is initiated by AID (activation induced deaminase), a single-strand DNA-specific deaminase, that introduces U:G mismatches in transcribed S regions. Subsequent processing by components of base excision repair and mismatch repair pathways introduces DNA double- stranded breaks (DSBs) in S regions. DSBs between two distinct S regions are synapsed and then ligated by end-joining. DSBs serve as obligatory intermediates of CSR; however, DSBs also constitute one of the most toxic lesions that can occur in a cell. A single unrepaired DSB can lead to cell death or can participate in chromosomal translocations, the hallmarks of many types of cancer, including lymphomas. Thus, CSR requires not only the generation but also efficient repair of DSBs. In this proposal we test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of AID plays an essential role in the generation of DSBs. We also explore the hypothesis that the DNA damage sensor ATM participates in inducing AID phosphorylation and repair of DSBs during the process. Impaired CSR leads to impaired ability to respond to pathogens while aberrant CSR is one of the major underlying factors in the ontogeny of B cell lymphomas. Our studies will thus have major impact on both immunodeficiency syndromes and B cell lymphomagenesis.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular mechanisms that mediate steatohepatitis, an increasingly prevalent condition in the Western world for which no therapies are available, are poorly understood. Using human genome wide association studies, we recently identified TTC39B (T39), which encodes a tetratricopeptide repeat-domain protein of unknown function, as a novel gene influencing HDL cholesterol levels. We have sought to understand the functions of T39 and its potential significance for human diseases using mouse models. These studies have revealed that T39 deficient mice are protected from development of fatty liver, steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis. T39 appears to be a scaffolding protein that regulates the post-transcriptional degradation of LXR, a transcription factor controlling cholesterol efflux genes and well as genes promoting triglyceride synthesis. In addition to beneficial lipoprotein changes and reduced atherosclerosis, T39 deficiency protects from hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis when mice are challenged with high fat/high cholesterol diets, and the underlying mechanisms of these novel observations will be the main focus of this proposal. We will also explore the basic functions of T39 such as its ability to facilitate ubiquitination and degradation
of LXR. Aim 1 will assess the mechanisms of reduced hepatic steatosis in T39-/- mice, Aim2 will determine tissue-specific effects of T39 in liver, spleen and hematopoietic cells; Aim 3 will explore the mechanisms of the post- transcriptional increase in LXR protein in T39-/- hepatocytes. These studies have the potential to uncover new treatments for steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses require the host biosynthetic machinery. A fundamental requirement is the host translational machinery for the synthesis of new viral proteins. The mechanisms by which viruses co-opt the host translational machinery and avoid the innate host defenses that act to degrade viral mRNA and diminish cellular protein synthesis to prevent or lessen the synthesis of viral proteins are not understood. The goal of this project is to define mechanisms by which mammalian reoviruses reprogram the host translational machinery to preferentially synthesize viral proteins. In particular, the project will focus on virus-mediated compartmentalization of the translational machinery, a novel pathogenic mechanism by which viral protein synthesis can be maintained during infection-induced stress. The hypotheses to be tested are that reovirus promotes the translation of its viral mRNAs by: (1) compartmentalizing translation factors and ribosomal subunits within defined sites of viral replication in the cytosol called viral factories; (2) by sequestering the GADD34/protein phosphatase 1 complex that dephosphorylates eIF2? within viral factories, thus, protecting translation of viral mRNAs from stress-induced inhibition of protein synthesis; and (3) by directly modifying the ribosome and altering its function to promote translation of non-canonical viral mRNA. Three Aims are proposed: (1) To identify mechanism(s) by which the host cell translational machinery is compartmentalized within viral factories in reovirus-infected cells; (2) To determine whether activation of the integrated stress response and compartmentalization of cellular GADD34 and protein phosphatase 1 within reovirus factories promotes translation of reovirus mRNAs; and (3) To determine the role of the viral nonstructural protein ?NS in enhancing the translation of reovirus mRNA in infected cells. Expected outcomes of this work are identification of the viral factors required for compartmentalization of the host translational machinery within viral factories, an understanding of the mechanisms by which reoviruses replicate in the face of ongoing phosphorylated eIF2? and activation of the integrated stress response, and a greater understanding of the role of the reovirus protein ?NS in co-opting the host translational machinery and modifying ribosome function. We expect that an important outcome of this proposal will be new basic information regarding viral strategies to overcome innate host defenses.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel form of long term synaptic depression (LTD) has been identified in the hippocampus associated with acute pharmacological increases in protein O-GlcNAc levels (O-linkage of N-acetylglucosamine to S/R residues of target proteins). Initial characterization of this LTD reveals an NMDA- and PKC-independent form of plasticity with strong evidence for postsynaptic AMPA receptor internalization at CA3-CA1 synapses mediated by direct O-GlcNAcylation of the GluA2 subunit. The current proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that the phenomenon of O-GlcNAc LTD can be applied therapeutically to neuronal hyperactivity to reduce epileptoform activity during seizures. We further hypothesize that the circuit dampening effects of increased O-GlcNAc and the synaptic LTD represent a shared expression mechanism of AMPA receptor internalization from CA1 dendrites. The small but growing list of synaptic proteins shown to undergo O- GlcNAcylation suggests that this cell signaling system plays a critical role in normal synaptic transmission and may serve further regulatory function during periods of pathological neuronal network activity. The experimental findings outlined in this proposal will serve as further characterization of the role of O-GlcNAc a CNS synapses, and examination of the protein O-GlcNAcylation as a possible therapeutic target.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  DNA viruses frequently activate a cellular mitogenic response at the outset of infection that poises the cell for the replication of the viral genome once it reaches the nucleus. Endocytic transport and signal transduction are increasingly being appreciated as tightly coupled events. Thus, the initial interactions of the virus with the cell surface, as well as during entry, are critical for maximizing virus yields. Polyomaviruses induce typical early (serum) response genes (i.e., c-myc, c-fos) upon cell attachment, and via their VP1 capsid protein bind well-characterized ganglioside receptors, which may be involved in initiating the signal transduction cascade. Although many viruses interact with cell surface glycan/ganglioside receptors, the use of lipid-based signaling mechanisms during cell entry may play critical and underappreciated roles in viral pathogenesis. Using cells deficient in glycolipid
modifications and ligands with specific capsid protein mutations affecting glycan and integrin binding we will characterize the transcriptional signals induced during polyomavirus attachment and entry. These studies of VP1 signaling may uncover intracellular signaling pathways that are critical to viruses engaging sequential receptors during infection. For example, SV40/BKV/JCV infections are blocked by the non-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, suggesting that identifying more specific signaling targets could lead to the development of small molecule inhibitors of polyomavirus infection. Although potentially very significant for the therapy of human BKV and JCV infections in immunocompromised individuals, additional targets may be identified that extend beyond the polyomaviruses to the many other viruses that use sialyl-glycans as attachment proteins, opening new avenues for anti-viral therapy.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium species, the etiologic agents of malaria, kill nearly 1 million people annually. They initially infect the liver as sporozoites, then they replicate as liver stages within hepatocytes to generate exoerythrocytic merozoites that initiate symptomatic blood stage infection. These preerythrocytic stages of infection are clinically silent and were thought to not provoke a significant innate immune response. Yet, recent findings from our group and collaborators have shown that preerythrocytic stages induce a pronounced innate immune response in the liver. The mechanisms by which these complex parasites induce an innate immune response and the downstream effects of these responses on parasite infection remain poorly defined. Understanding the innate immune response to this eukaryotic, intracellular pathogen is important in its own right but also a critical missing piece in the puzzl to understand the development of sterilizing adaptive immunity engendered by whole parasite immunizations. Therefore, we propose to identify which innate immune responses are activated by wild-type and attenuated Plasmodium preerythrocytic parasites and to determine how these innate immune responses influence protective adaptive immune responses. Using gene expression analysis and functional assays, we have shown that liver stage infection induces an innate immune response mediated by type I and type II interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. We have also shown that lymphocytes infiltrate the liver within days following infection and that this
infiltration is strongly dependent on type I IFN (IFN-1) signaling. Furthermore, this innate response reduces the initial infection. These results indicate a link between IFN-1, lymphocyte recruitment, and subsequent innate parasite elimination. Our preliminary data also shows that this IFN-1 driven innate response shapes the adaptive immune response that is engendered by whole parasite immunizations. This we demonstrate with mice deficient in key IFN-1 signaling molecules, which surprisingly, are better protected by whole parasite immunizations. In this proposal, we intend to further delineate the generation and consequences of an IFN-mediated innate immune response to Plasmodium liver infection. In Aim 1 we will identify the host-parasite interactions that initiate this IFN-mediated innate immune response and identify the cell types in the liver that respond to IFN. In Aim 2 we will characterize cell-specific responses withi the liver following infection and identify cytokine and chemokine receptors that are necessary for innate lymphocyte infiltration. Additionally, we will evaluate the cellular mechanisms by which these innate cells eliminate liver stage parasites. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate how IFN-1-mediated signaling influences the development of adaptive immune responses engendered by whole parasite immunizations. Understanding the nature of the early innate immune response will reveal how a complex eukaryotic parasite engages early host immune defenses. Equally important, it will also identify innate molecular pathways to target for improvement of adaptive immune responses after vaccination that aims to protect against malaria infection.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

flux determinations in complex in vivo metabolic rodent models and for human clinical investigation for 
members of the Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research Center (ES-DRC). The SIMC provides an array of in 
vitro metabolic methodologies that augment in vivo investigations. These services provide investigators with 
specialized assays to determine substrate flux dynamics and metabolite profiles at the organelle, cellular, 
tissue and whole body level thereby elucidating the integrative network of disorders in glucose, protein and 
lipid metabolism. Through these collaborative efforts with the other Cores of the ES-DRC, the effects of defined 
pharmacological, dietary, environmental and genetic alterations are thoroughly characterized for their effects 
on glucose and lipid homeostasis, insulin action, and metabolism. The role of candidate molecules in relevant 
tissues (i.e., neurons, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, adipocytes and beta cells) that are related to glucose 
homeostasis can be specifically delineated by thorough and definitive analyses using in vivo and in vitro 
experimentation with a step-wise guided approach in rodents and humans as well as in cell lines. To 
accomplish these goals, the SIMC will: 1) perform in vivo stable isotope substrate flux assays for the 
determination of rates of protein synthesis, lipogenesis, peripheral glucose disposal, hepatic glucose recycling, 
glucose-glycerol cycling and glucose-lactate cycling; 2) determine glycolysis (extracellular acidification rates) 
and mitochondrial oxygen consumption (mitochondrial respiration) in isolated cells, tissue explants or tissue 
culture, using Seahorse Biosciences Flux Analyzers, as well as more comprehensive stable isotope flux 
assessments; 3) perform targeted hypothesis-driven assessments of plasma and tissue metabolite profiles for 
key metabolites in the glycolytic/gluconeogenic, pentose phosphate, and tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle pathways, 
and lipid metabolism, including fatty acid, fatty acyl CoA and fatty acyl carnitine profiles; 4) provide mentorship 
and assistance with protocol development , which uses mass spectrometer-based flux and metabolite profiling 
methods for the evaluation of molecular biochemical targets relevant to the control of glucose and fatty acid 
homeostasis; and 5) coordinate these efforts with other ES-DRC and Institutional Core facilities at Einstein and 
Mount Sinai. All of these services are available to investigators new to diabetes research, as well as to 
investigators working on diabetes-related projects that can be enriched and extended by the use of the 
expertise and facilities of this Core.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intervertebral disc herniation involves both inflammatory cytokine expression and compression of the nerve roots that may contribute to a painful lumbar radiculopathy (sciatica). Much recent work has focused on use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists to attenuate radiculopathy in animal models. A recent clinical trial of systemically administered TNF blocking antibody (infliximab) revealed no benefit, however, in reducing patient symptoms or restoring function in lumbar radiculopathy. Instead, epidural administration of a TNF receptor (etanercept) showed some therapeutic benefits in a limited cohort. This suggests potential for local delivery of antagonists of inflammatory mediators to attenuate the symptoms and neuropathology of radiculopathy.  We have experience with injectable and in situ forming elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) depots that provide for sustained local drug release. Our studies show that injectable ELP depots persist in the perineural space ~8-fold longer than soluble proteins and decrease peak serum drug exposure by 14- fold. Here we propose to synthesize novel ELP-based depots to provide for sustained release of a safe, small molecule inhibitor of inflammation - curcumin. We propose that an injectable, in situ forming curcumin drug depot will provide for rapid reversal of symptoms and neuropathology associated with radiculopathy in a rat model, while providing for important benefits of reducing peak serum drug levels and total drug use.  In Aim 1, we will synthesize a depot-forming curcumin-ELP conjugate. Curcumin will be modified to include chemically reactive amines for reversible coupling to ELP. Depots formed from curcumin-ELP conjugates will be evaluated for release kinetics and bioactivity against TNF-induced neuroinflammation in cell systems and dorsal root ganglia in vitro. In Aim 2, we will design an ELP depot optimized for entrapping curcumin, and evaluate curcumin-ELP depots as in Aim 1. In vitro tests of curcumin release from ELP depots and bioactivity will be performed as in Aim 1, and also compared against corresponding values for corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide) to test for therapeutic potential against the current standard-of-care. In Aim 3, we will evaluate top curcumin-depot candidates for an ability to modify sensitivity and functional deficits in a rat model of radiculopathy. Shortly after placement of autologous nucleus pulposus at the lumbar dorsal root ganglion, rats develop mechanical allodynia and abnormal gait. Here, rats will be evaluated for parameters of gait, allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia prior to and after transforaminal delivery of in situ forming curcumin-ELP depots; all data will be compared against values for curcumin or corticosteroid alone. These longitudinal gait and sensitivity measures, as well as spinal cord and ganglion markers of neuropathology, will be compared between no treatment, drug depot and bolus drug-treated rats to test for an ability for curcumin to modify radiculopathy and associated neuropathology.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research Center (ES-DRC) supports the discovery, application and translation of scientific knowledge for the treatment and cure of diabetes. Building upon the established successes of Einstein's Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC) and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Diabetes and Obesity Metabolism Institute (DOMI), the ES-DRC serves as a nexus to i) enhance diabetes research, education and training; ii) attract, mentor and retain research investigators; iii) provide state- of-the-art Core services to maximize research productivity; iv) foster interdisciplinary collaborations locally and regionally, and v) promote the translation of scientific findings from the bench to the bedside and ultimately the community, especially in underserved and minority populations. To accomplish these goals, we reorganized the ES-DRC into five cutting-edge biomedical cores spanning the basic, pre-clinical, and clinical research `translational' divide: 1) Animal Physiology; 2) Stable Isotope & Metabolomics; 3) Human Islet & Adenovirus; 4) Biomarker & Analytical Research; and 5) Translational Research Cores. At the molecular, cellular, tissue, animal based integrated physiology levels, we provide the infrastructure to investigate the basic mechanisms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These investigations are translated into human based clinical investigation, population based studies that include large cohort studies of under-represented minorities, women and HIV infected individuals. To attain these goals, we use the support of an Administrative Core for which its personnel have overall responsibility for management, integration and promotion of research and training among Einstein, Mount Sinai and our affiliated institutional Center members. This Core also provides support for our highly successful Pilot & Feasibility Study Program, Enrichment activities and coordination between the Einstein and Mount Sinai Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). This infrastructure already allowed us to establish several new innovative programs including a new microgrant initiative, and establishment of a laboratory information management system (LMIS) for ordering, billing, monitoring experimental progress, data acquisition, data analyses and data distribution to investigators. In parallel, the ES-DRC research cores provide robust cutting-edge methodologies and equipment necessary to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of diabetes in model organisms and in human-based studies that can be translated to clinical care.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Abstract  Stroke is a major medical concern for United States military veterans. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a catastrophic event in the pathogenesis of ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury. Our recent studies suggested that structural alterations in brain endothelial cells (EC), including abnormal actin polymerization and the resulting redistribution of junctional proteins, is a novel mechanism responsible for early BBB leakage after I/R (30 min-3h); while matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/9 activation, a predominant mechanism thought to contribute to post-stroke BBB disruption, contribute to the BBB leakage to larger molecules (>40kDa) in a relatively delayed manner. Therefore, restoring EC structure/function may offer an innovative therapeutic strategy for early BBB protection against I/R, while blocking MMP2/9 may provide a relatively delayed protection to BBB.  Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), a member of the small heat shock protein family, confers neuroprotection in several models of CNS diseases, including I/R brain injury. In addition to its well-known protein chaperone and anti-apoptotic functions, HSP27 may act as a potent actin depolymerization factor in certain cell types such as EC, thus potentially inhibiting actin polymerization-mediated BBB disruption. Further, HSP27 may inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB, a central signaling molecule for the production of MMP2/9 and pro-inflammatory mediators. We recently observed that HSP27 is transiently upregulated in brain EC after I/R. However, the precise role of HSP27 in the functional integrity of EC following I/R and the underlying mechanism remain unknown.  Using transgenic mice overexpressing HSP27 and the lentiviral gene-transfection approach, we have obtained novel pilot data showing that HSP27 overexpression protects the endothelium from I/R-induced hyperpermeability in vitro and in vivo; that HSP27 inhibited oxygen glucose deprivation-induced actin polymerization and redistribution of junctional proteins in EC; and that intravenous administration of HSP27 containing a cell permeable transduction domain (TAT-HSP27) enabled rapid delivery of the protein into brain micro-vasculatures, reduced BBB damage and inhibited MMP2/9 activity after I/R. This proposal will further explore the BBB protective effect of HSP27 on I/R brain injury and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The central hypothesis to be tested is that HSP27 protects BBB against I/R injury by stabilizing EC cytoskeletal organization in microvasculature early after I/R and inhibiting the production of MMP2/9 as well as pro-inflammatory proteins. The following specific aims are proposed:  Aim 1: To determine whether endothelial targeted overexpression of HSP27 is sufficient to provide early protection on BBB integrity and to confer long term protection against cerebral I/R.  Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that HSP27 protects endothelial integrity following I/R by dualistic mechanisms: stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and
inhibiting NFkB-dependent MMP2/9 production and inflammation.  Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that post-stroke delivery of TAT-HSP27 to EC protects against BBB damage and improves outcomes in both young adult and aged mice.  The proposed study attempts to develop HSP27 into a novel, clinically feasible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate post-stroke BBB damage, brake down the progression of brain damage, and improve long-term neurological functions in stroke victims. The successful completion of this proposed study will help improve the quality of life for veterans suffering from stroke.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Despite the advent of effective statin therapies, atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of cardiovascular disease in the United States and worldwide. In addition to the well-known role of cholesterol as a major risk factor contributing to cardiovascular disease, evidence from many laboratories points to two other critical contributory factors, namely, dysregulated inflammation and metabolism. The latter two factors are inter- dependent, and metabolically active cells, in response to excess nutrient input, can generate a low-grade, chronic inflammation, referred to as metaflammation. This concept has become increasingly important as an epidemic of obesity in the Western world is driving the incidence of insulin resistance, diabetes, and athero- sclerosis, and consequent morbidity and mortality. The long-term goal of our Program Project is to gain a deep and mechanistic understanding of the genetic events and cellular and physiological processes underlying the connections between inflammation, metabolism, and atherogenesis. A central hypothesis is that macrophages are critically important early responders to metabolic stress, and that they in turn, by paracrine mechanisms, influence the responses of other cells crucial in metaflammation, particularly adipocytes and endothelial cells. 
The specific objectives of this Program are (i) to understand the molecular basis of interleukin-1 receptor/Toll- like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages and EC, and delineate their roles in the initiation and pathogenesis of obesity-associated inflammatory disease (Project 1, Dr. Xiaoxia Li), (ii) to utilize mouse genetic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to identify atherosclerosis modifier genes and genetic modifiers of macrophage foam cell lipid droplet metabolism (Project 2, Dr. Jonathan Smith), and (iii) to determine the noncanonical function of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) as a critical effector of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in adipocytes and macrophages, and its contribution to diet-induced obesity and atherosclerosis (Project 3, Dr. Paul Fox). The Project Leaders are a highly integrated and synergistic group employing distinct but complementary approaches, i.e., cell signaling (Li), mouse genetics/genomics/proteomics (Smith), and biochemistry (Fox). Three scientific Cores - Primary Cell and Mouse Metabolism, Atherosclerosis and Lipoprotein Analysis, and Macromolecular Interaction - and an Administration Core provide multi-project support, expertise, and service in a cost-effective manner, significantly strengthening each of the Projects. We anticipate our collaborative effort will lead to the discovery of novel genes, signaling pathways, and macro-molecular interactions that promote or restrict atherogenesis, and that can be leveraged to reduce disease initiation and progression, and support health and longevity.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis remains a major public health problem in Western-style societies, with rapidly increasing incidence worldwide. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MPs) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs) participate in early fatty streak formation, intermediate plaque progression, and importantly, in advanced plaque necrotic core expansion and fibrous cap thinning that determine the likelihood of plaque rupture, the most frequent proximal cause of clinical events such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Interventions that decrease pro-inflammatory activities, prevent VSMC demise, and promote macrophage clearance function could break the cycle of cell recruitment, death, and corpse accumulation that drives necrotic core expansion and plaque instability. To promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies that mediate such desirable activities, this project seeks to understand molecular mechanisms controlling MP and VSMC activities that contribute to vulnerable plaque formation and rupture. The focus of these studies is a protein called allograft inflammatory factor-1 (Aif-1), also known as Ionized binding adapter-1 (Iba1), which was initially characterized as a cytoplasmic MP protein involved directly in phagocytosis and actin bundling. Aif-1 lacks a classical secretory signal, but recent reports suggest that Aif-1 has
activities as a soluble factor outside the cell, including pro-inflammatory effects. We hypothesize
that EC and IC Aif-1 mediate distinct cellular functions, and that the ability to manipulate these functions separately may have therapeutic value - selective blockade of EC Aif-1 without affecting IC Aif-1 could limit inflammatory cytokine production, while preserving the phagocytic activities that enable MPs to clear cellular debris that results from inflammation and cell death. We propose three aims, in which we will compare how IC and EC Aif-1 differentially affect MP and VSMC activities, test the relative importance of MP and VSMC Aif-1 in in vivo mouse models of vascular remodeling and atherogenesis, and determine whether inhibition of EC Aif-1 without limiting IC Aif-1 can reverse the processes that promote necrotic core expansion and plaque destabilization. We anticipate that these studies will provide molecular insight into Aif-1 function and test its viability as a potential therapeutic target in strategies to decrease plaque rupture.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemokine-driven inflammation plays an important role in the reparative response following myocardial infarction and is critically involved in the pathogenesis of adverse remodeling. Differential expression of chemokine receptors by monocyte and lymphocyte subsets governs their trafficking in the infarcted myocardium resulting in infiltration with subpopulations that exhibit distinct functional properties. We propose that beyond their involvement in initiation and activation of the post-infarction inflammatory reaction, chemokine-mediated interactions also play an important role in suppression of inflammation through recruitment of leukocyte subsets with inhibitory properties. Our studies suggest that signaling through the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) mediates recruitment of suppressive monocyte subsets and regulatory T cells (Tregs), a CD4+ T lymphocyte subpopulation with an essential role in regulation of immune responses. Accordingly, the objective of the current proposal is to investigate the role of Tregs and inhibitory monocyte subpopulations in regulation of post-infarction inflammation, to study the molecular signals responsible for their protective effects, and to explore the role of chemokine signaling in their recruitment in the infarcted myocardium. These concepts will be examined in three specific aims: Specific aim 1: to investigate the role of monocyte subsets with anti-inflammatory properties in controlling the post-infarction inflammatory response. Specific aim 2: to study the involvement of Tregs in inhibition of inflammatory injury, in prevention of excessive matrix degradation and in protection from the development of adverse remodeling following myocardial infarction. Specific aim 3: to investigate chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions responsible for recruitment of Tregs and effector T cells in the infarcted myocardium.  Chemokine-mediated suppression of inflammation through recruitment of regulatory mononuclear cell subpopulations appears to play an essential role in cardiac repair and protects from the development of adverse remodeling. Understanding the effects of inhibitory monocytes and Tregs may identify novel therapeutic targets for pharmacologic interventions and cell therapy in patients with myocardial infarction.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid organ transplantation is a life-saving procedure to treat end-stage organ failure. However, transplantation of organs between genetically distinct individuals results in acute graft rejection by the immune system unless patients take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives. The strength of the anti-transplant immune response, also called the alloresponse, is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. In mouse models of skin and heart transplantation, we have previously found that bacterial infections at the time of transplantation can enhance the alloresponse and promote transplant rejection. This supports the role of microbial infections as environmental factors that can modulate alloresponses, although these are not frequent environmental factors. In contrast, the communities of commensal bacteria that inhabit our body, collectively called the microbiota, share many microbial patterns with infectious bacteria, and are constantly present at barrier surfaces such as the skin and the intestine. Recent evidence indicates that the composition of the microbiota is determined by the immune system and that the microbiota, in turn, drives several effector functions of the immune system. Therefore, we have proposed the hypothesis that the microbiota is an important and omnipresent environmental factor that can enhance alloresponses and promote graft rejection. To address this question, we have used both sterile mice devoid of microbiota and conventional mice treated with broad spectrum antibiotics to reduce microbiota diversity. Our preliminary results show that both sets of mice display prolonged skin graft survival compared with control animals, demonstrating that the microbiota indeed enhances the strength of the alloresponse and accelerates graft rejection. In this application, we propose to investigate the mechanisms by which the microbiota promotes graft rejection, as well as the consequences on the composition of the microbiota of immunosuppression and ongoing alloresponses. Finally, we will attempt to manipulate the microbiota for therapeutic purposes to limit the strength of the alloresponse and prolong graft survival. This research will guide follow up studies in humans to identify the impact of microbiota
on alloimmunity and graft outcome. As the composition of the microbiota can be manipulated via anti-microbials, as well as prebiotics (diet), probiotics (beneficial bacteria) and postbiotics (products of bacterial metabolism), this line of research has important possible clinical benefits.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A TBI produces complex pathophysiology contributing to progressive cellular dysfunction and death that can culminate in impaired motor and cognitive abilities. Despite advances in understanding the multifaceted pathobiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI), no therapeutic has been approved for the treatment of TBI in clinical
trials. Previous work from our lab demonstrates that deficits in acetylcholine release in the hippocampus contribute to the manifestation of neurobehavioral dysfunction after injury, but little
is known about the mechanisms underlying impaired neurotransmission. In the uninjured brain, the formation of the N- ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex facilitates vesicular docking and neurotransmitter release; however, the effects of TBI on the SNARE complex have not been examined. We hypothesize that alterations in the SNARE complex and synaptic vesicle distribution contribute to impaired neurotransmission and behavioral dysfunction after TBI. The proposed work will test the efficacy of lithium to attenuate intrasynaptic impairments, promote synaptic plasticity and cell survival, and improve neurobehavioral function after TBI. To this end, we will utilize rat and mouse models of TBI to examine the therapeutic capacity of lithium. Additionally, we will examine the specificity of lithium's action in the synapse using commercially available cysteine string protein alpha (CSPa) knockout mice. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of lithium on SNARE protein abundance and complex formation at multiple time points after TBI. Additionally, we will examine the effect of lithium on synaptic vesicular distribution and density and neurotransmitter release after TBI by transmission electron microscopy and microdialysis, respectively. In Aim 2, we will examine the effect of lithium on synaptic plasticity, hippocampal neuron survival, and neurobehavioral function in the weeks following TBI. The proposed work will provide the first evaluation of changes in synaptic vesicle distribution and alterations in the SNARE complex after TBI. Successful completion of this work will provide valuable insights into our understanding of synaptic dysfunction and the development of lithium based approaches to promote recovery in the injured brain.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases exert a massive burden on human health, and our long term objective is to attenuate the excessive accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that is central to many of these diseases. The tunica media of the normal artery is composed of alternating circumferential layers of VSMCs and elastic lamellae. Diverse arterial disorders, including atherosclerosis, restenosis, pulmonary hypertension and supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) are plagued by defective elastic lamellae as well as hypermuscularization. SVAS, a devastating human disease characterized by an increased VSMC burden that occludes large arteries, is caused by heterozygous null mutations in the elastin gene ELN. Similarly, elastin mutant mice develop hypermuscularization and stenosis of large arteries, such as the aorta. Major vascular surgery is the only current treatment
for SVAS as no effective pharmacological options are available. A major obstacle to developing effective therapies for vascular disorders is the poor understanding of the cellular source(s) of excess VSMCs; indeed no prior studies have traced the lineage of any cell populations in elastin mutants. In addition, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying aortic hypermuscularization in elastin mutants are not well defined. Our initial studies indicate that integrin ?expression and integrin signaling is robustly upregulated in the elastin mutant aorta and that reduction of ?levels or activity attenuates the excessive muscularization. Furthermore, reduction of the dosage of the gene encoding ? Itgb3, extends the viability of Eln(-/-) pups which is unprecedented for any genetic or pharmacological intervention. A potentially attractive strategy for reducing arterial hypermuscularization in SVAS is attenuating the increased ?expression. Although little is known regarding regulation of ?expression, the growth arrest-specific homeobox (Gax) transcription factor is expressed in VSMCs and Gax overexpression reduces ?levels, proliferation and migration. We hypothesize that in elastin mutants, Gax downregulation induces integrin ?expression in pre-existing aortic smooth muscle resulting in aberrant VSMC orientation, proliferation and migration and thus aortic stenosis. This proposal utilizes studies of transgenic mutant mice, VSMCs isolated from the murine aorta and human SVAS aortic tissue and cells to test this hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) in the elastin mutant aorta, identify the cellular source(s) of excessive VSMCs; 2) in elastin deficient mice, murine VSMCs and human SVAS-derived smooth muscle cells, elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying integrin ?induced excess aortic muscularization; and 3) elucidate the role of Gax in mediating enhanced integrin ?expression and hypermuscularization in elastin mutants. Taken together, our proposed studies will delineate mechanisms underlying the identified link between elastin deficiency, integrin ?and aortic hypermuscularization and thereby provide concrete steps towards developing novel therapeutic strategies for SVAS and other vasculoproliferative diseases.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Alterations in cognitive/affective/sleep functioning are among the most challenging side effects experienced by 80% of patients with metastatic melanoma (MM) or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) undergoing high dose Interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy.1 Altered cognition2 includes a wide array of symptoms such as alterations in concentration, attention, short-term memory, confusion, mental fatigue, executive functioning, abstraction, language, basic arithmetic and orientation;3,4 affective symptoms2 include mood alterations, depression, anxiety, psychosis, hallucinations, aggression, suicide ideation and coma;5-7 and sleep symptoms include insomnia (initial, middle, delayed) and hypersomnia.8  Methods: This exploratory, descriptive, mixed methods case study design will describe the trajectory of transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms in ten high-dose IL-2 cases. Each IL-2 case consists of the IL-2 patient, care partner, and primary nurse. Through case study analyses, qualitative data from the care partner and nurse will be synthesized with qualitative and quantitative data from the patient to inform and describe the patterns of cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms experienced by the patient during treatment.  The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1) Describe transient and residual cognitive (language, concentration, confusion, attention, short-term memory, and orientation), affective (depression, anxiety, mood alterations), and sleep (insomnia, hypersomnia) symptoms in patients during up to four hospitalizations for high-dose IL-2 therapy. Aim 2) Describe patient transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms as qualitatively reported by each patient's care partner, and primary nurse during each hospital admission for IL-2 therapy. Aim 3) Describe the trajectory of transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms in IL-2 patients over the total number of hospitalizations, synthesizing patient data with care partner and nurse reports of symptom change.  Significance: This will be the first study to describe IL-2-induced cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms longitudinally from the perspective of the individuals experiencing the treatment course: the patient, their care partner, and their nurse. These individuals will describe the trajectory, duration and severity of these symptoms through journaling, interviews, and cognitive/affective/sleep measures. Results from this study will identify critical time points along the symptom trajectory to target interventions. These data will
inform future interventional studies that help patients during periods of aggressive medical treatment, supporting their care partners, and nurses.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION:  Bacterial Infections are an important and emerging global healthcare issue. ?-Lactam antibiotics, one of the most important developments in modern medicine, have saved millions of lives and continue to serve as the major therapy to treat bacterial infections. The highly reactive four- membered ?-lactam ring is the key structure for dictating efficacy of this class of antibiotics. Unfortunately, bacteria are rapidly developing resistance to one or more of the most frequently used antibiotics. ?-Lactamase production and excretion is a major defense mechanism employed by several drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. For example, nearly 30% of hospital- acquired infections are identified as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains that are resistant to penicillin, methicillin and many other ?-lactam antibiotics, leading to serious infection problems for patients. Currently, vancomycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid are among the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. Although these antibiotics are among the strongest of their classes, the high frequency use has resulted in their decreased susceptibility. Efficient antibiotics and/or antimicrobial agents are in high demand, but have limited success in fighting bacterial resistance. We discover a class of charged metallopolymers that exhibits synergistic effects against multidrug resistant bacteria by effectively lysing bacterial cells and efficiently disarming activity of ?-lactamases. Various conventional ?-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin-G, amoxicillin, ampicillin and cefazolin, are protected from ?-lactamase hydrolysis via
the formation of unique ion-pairs between their carboxylate anions and cationic metallopolymers. There are at least three innovations involved in this project: (1) our approaches effectively prevent bacterial resistance by protecting and reinstating antibiotics; (2) more importantly our metallopolymer platforms eliminate the possibility of recurrence of bacterial resistance via disarming ?- lactamases and disrupting cell membranes; (3) these metallopolymers are non- or minimally cytotoxic for mammalian cells. Our research and discoveries could provide a new pathway to designing macromolecular scaffolds to regenerate vitality of conventional antibiotics to kill multidrug resistant bacteria and superbugs.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptococcal meningitis is a leading cause of AIDS-related mortality worldwide. Circulating cryptococcal antigens can be detected weeks before the onset of neurological symptoms, and pre-emptive anti-fungal therapy can prevent cryptococcal meningitis and death. Unfortunately, most clinics in cryptococcal endemic regions do not have access to laboratory-based testing for cryptococcal antigens. A newly-approved, rapid cryptococcal antigen test can facilitate implementing a clinic-based screening strategy in any resource-limited setting, which, when coupled with oral anti-fungal therapy, could save thousands of lives each year worldwide. However, evidence on the feasibility and impact of conducting point-of-care testing for cryptococcal antigens in a clinic-based setting is needed. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in clinical research with a focus on implementation science to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment of cryptococcal infections and prevention of cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. I will draw upon the methodological training of the K23 award and leverage the existing research infrastructure of my co-mentors and collaborators in Durban, South Africa to accomplish my scientific objective: to better understand the value of point-of-care testing, clinic-based screening, and implementation science for cryptococcal disease among HIV-infected adults in resource-limited settings. My hypothesis is that clinic-based, nurse-driven, point-of-care screening for cryptococcal antigens at the time of initial HIV diagnosis will be feasible and will improve patient outcomes. I will tes this hypothesis through the following four specific aims: (1) To estimate CD4-specific prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia and cumulative incidence of cryptococcal meningitis and mortality for those with and without cryptococcal antigenemia within 12 months of HIV diagnosis in a standard-of-care, lab-based serum CrAg screening program, (2) To evaluate a rapid point-of-care LFA CrAg test by measuring test characteristics of whole blood and urine samples, compared with gold-standard serum-based tests, (3) To estimate cumulative incidence of cryptococcal meningitis and mortality within 12 months of HIV diagnosis when implementing an active, clinic-based screening program for CrAg in urine and/or whole blood among newly- diagnosed HIV-infected adults, and to compare cumulative incidence of cryptococcal meningitis and mortality to the standard-of-care, lab-based serum CrAg screening program (measured in Aim #1), and (4) To assess the long-term clinical outcomes, cost, and cost-effectiveness of intensified CrAg screening, compared to lab- based CrAg screening, among newly-diagnosed HIV-infected adults in South Africa. I am well positioned to accomplish these aims, based on my educational and mentorship plans, as well as my experience conducting a clinic-based, nurse-driven evaluation of a point-of-care diagnostic test for tuberculosis. I will draw upon the guidance of my renowned mentors and collaborators, who have extensive experience in HIV care, cryptococcal disease, clinical research, evaluating screening strategies, and cost-effectiveness analysis, while also developing my own distinct research trajectory. My approach is innovative by: (1) validating a point-of-care test in a clinical setting by nurses, (2) evaluatig the impact of clinic-based screening on patient outcomes, and (3) use of a novel, rapid cryptococcal antigen testing platform. The proposed research is significant because it will provide the tools to implement clinic-based screening for cryptococcus, a common and fatal disease in resource-limited settings, and provide a platform to launch my career as an independent investigator.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under this project, we have previously found using intravital microcopy imaging in a humanized mouse model of sickle cell disease (SCD) that adherent leukocytes recruited in inflamed venules, played a direct role in VOC by interacting with circulating erythrocytes (RBC). We have determined that RBCs interact specifically with adherent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in vivo. We have identified E-selectin ligand-1 as a major adhesion receptor sending signals that contribute to activate the beta2 integrin Mac-1 specifically at the leading edge of crawling PMNs. Neutrophil Mac-1 captures circulating RBC and thus contribute to VOC. Our preliminary studies suggest that VOC is mediated by a subset of PMNs (senescent phenotype) which we propose to characterize. Other exciting preliminary studies suggest that neural signals regulate the expression of adhesion molecules on venular endothelial cells through circadian adrenergic signals and that these signals can modulate the inflammatory response and the clearance of senescent PMNs. In Specific Aim 1, we will test whether senescent PMNs promote heterotypic interactions and acute VOC in SCD. We will dissect the contribution of PMN aging vs. activation on their ability to promote in vivo heterotypi RBC-WBC interactions following ex vivo aging and stimulation. We will evaluate gain- and loss-of function model systems that promote or reduce senescent PMN clearance in the bone marrow or survival in the circulation. Preliminary data indicate that circadian adrenergic signals are locally delivered by nerves of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, SNS nerves innervate arterioles, but not venules where leukocytes are recruited, raising the intriguing question as to how these signals are transmitted to venular endothelial cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will define how SNS nerves control endothelial cell function in venules. We will track in vivo signal transduction by imaging calcium waves using GCaMP3 mice following direct neural stimulation of the genitofemoral nerve or pericytes by micropipette stimulation in collaboration with Dr. David Spray (Einstein). We will identify genetically the cellular and molecular basis by specific deletion of connexins or beta2 adrenergic receptors (Adrb2fl/fl) in pericytes or endothelial cells, and we will investigate the functional consequences of tissue-specific deletions
on circadian leukocyte recruitment in healthy wild-type mice and in SCD mice. In addition to the SNS, our preliminary data also suggest a role for parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) in leukocyte recruitment. We will investigate in Specific Aim 3 the role of PNS (cholinergic) signals in leukocyte adhesion and sickle cell vaso-occlusion. We will explore in collaboration with Dr. Kevin Tracey (Feinstein Institute for Medical Research), the influence of vagal stimulation and nicotinic receptor signaling. We will also evaluate the role of the type 1 muscarinic receptor (Chrm1) using pharmacologic and genetic analyses since our preliminary studies suggest a role for this receptor in leukocyte trafficking. These studies will provide new insight on the mechanisms regulating sickle cell VOC and lead to novel ways to target inflammation.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood diagnoses are chronic and devastating with respect to costs to the individual and the healthcare system, and are more prevalent than any other class of disorders. When these disorders present concurrently, the significant public health implications and societal costs are intensified. Despite high rates of comorbidity and underlying mechanistic similarities between treatment protocols, single disorder evidence- based psychotherapy protocols for these disorders have traditionally been recommended to treat emotional disorders sequentially. Moreover, when clinicians are presented with complex case presentations, they are often unprepared to treat them and move away from evidence-based approaches, potentially increasing the burden on the mental health system. The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is an innovative transdiagnostic protocol with promising evidence for successful treatment of emotional disorders, both for standalone and comorbid presentations, including the classification of not otherwise specified (NOS) disorders. To date, there have only been efficacy trials of the UP, which limit generalizability and do not address the larger public health impact and effectiveness in routine clinical care settings with both psychiatric and medical comorbidity. To address this critical limitation, the applicant proposes a pilot feasibility, acceptability, and
tolerability study of the UP in patients with diverse psychiatric and medical comorbidity to manualized supportive therapy within a hospital. The deployment focused model (DFM) will inform design and statistical analyses. An additional aim includes determining the feasibility, acceptability, perceived fit and satisfaction of the UP in clinic settings through surveying and interviewing stakeholders in the system that are implementing the UP through the study. Consultation with stakeholders can minimize the time required to collect and assess fit within the larger system and, therefore, minimizes the time lag between science and practice in routine care settings. This study addresses an important public health concern by examining the effectiveness of the UP in a new population as a strategy for treatment of common and debilitating mental disorders in routine care settings. Furthermore, the proposed research aims will complement a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant to become an independent investigator with expertise in implementation science and effectiveness research. Results from the study will provide important information about whether or not this efficacious treatment can be effective, efficient, and ready for implementation in routine care settings in which psychiatric and medical comorbidity are common. This study will also serve as a model of deploying efficacious treatments into generalist clinics.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I earned a Ph.D. in Sociology from UCLA in 2006, and an M.S. in statistics from UCLA in 2008. As a student affiliate of the California Center for Population Research, I received a comprehensive education in social demography and social stratification, and rigorous training in research methodology and statistical techniques for analyzing large-scale survey data. During this time, I also developed a technique for linking empirical estimates of individuals' preferences for neighborhoods with agent-based models to explore the segregation dynamics implied by individuals' residential mobility decisions. While this work is at the vanguard of social research, it relies on a primitive and highly unrealistic conception of individuals' residential choice behavior. This is not unique to my research. The statistical models used in quantitative social science and public health research are rarely (if ever) a plausible model of the underlying behavior or decision-making process that gave rise to the social phenomenon under investigation. Over the past year, I have learned that researchers in departments of Marketing at business schools have highly sophisticated statistical models of how people navigate their environment and make decisions, which draw on insights from cognitive science and decision theory. But these methods have never been applied in population health, for example, to how people choose among neighborhoods, schools, jobs, or entrees in a cafeteria.  Based on my initial forays into this area, I have found marketing choice models are orders of magnitude more difficult to master than techniques I have taught myself in the past. There is no standard statistical software, and the programs are usually written from scratch; there is no single model or methodological approach, but rather a loose toolkit of techniques or strategies that are customized to a specific application. In addition, the models often require Bayesian estimation techniques (which require significant expertise outside of standardized software packages). The K01 Mentored Research Scientist Award would provide protected time for me to: (1) master the statistical skills involved in estimating these models, an gain a formal understanding of the underlying theories of decision-making; (2) adapt the marketing statistical models to new substantive applications-the study of residential mobility and mate choice (as observed on an online dating site); (3) develop a methodological framework for linking these cognitively plausible models of individual decision-making with agent-based models to understand the implications of decision strategies for aggregate population dynamics; and (4) explore how this statistical framework may be applied to a broader range of decision-making applications relevant to health research. I have developed a course plan to provide more formal training in the statistical techniques and theoretical frameworks that underpin the statistical models of decision-making used in marketing research. In addition, I intend to get a comprehensive overview of the decision literature in psychology to supplement what has up to now been self-study. I will supplement the coursework in statistical modeling with frequent interactions with my primary mentor, Fred Feinberg. The bulk of my training will take place at the University of Michigan, where Feinberg and Diez Roux are also in residence. I will have access to the data management, computing, and administrative resources of the Population Studies Center, the Department of Sociology, and the Center for the Study of Complex Systems. Both Sociology and Population Studies have provided me with office space for the duration of the grant period.  My short-term goals are to master the statistical skills involved in
estimating these models and gain a formal understanding of the underlying theories of decision-making; and also to adapt the marketing statistical models to new substantive applications-the study of residential mobility and mate choice (as observed on an online dating site). In the longer term, my goals are to develop a methodological framework for linking these cognitively plausible models of individual decision-making with agent-based models to understand the implications of decision strategies for aggregate patterns of social integration or separation; and
to explore how this statistical framework may be applied to a broader range of decision-making applications relevant to health research. My proposed research projects apply the choice-modeling framework in two areas of research: mate choice (as observed on an online dating website) and neighborhood choice. These are two specific instances of a general class of choice problems where people choose-with varying degrees of habit or deliberation- from a moderate to large number of potential options. When confronted with this sort of choice problem, decision theorists have repeatedly shown that people tend to invoke screening rules to simplify the choice problem. I will use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey to estimate cognitively plausible choice models to capture these screening rules at multiple stages. My mate choice project makes use of a rich dataset I recently acquired from an online dating. I will first estimate a multi-stage choice model aimed at identifying the rules used
at each stage, and explore how strategies for mate search and mate choice differ across demographic areas. I will later extend our models to allow for learning and adaptive responses. In both the neighborhood and mate choice case, the cognitively plausible choice models will be coupled with realistic agent-based models to explore the co-evolution of individual behavior and the social environment.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disease with rising prevalence and a high mortality rate. Current treatment is limited to open or endovascular surgery, a procedure for which only 10% of AAA patients are eligible, highlighting an urgent need for new mechanistic understandings of AAA. With a long term goal to identify new therapeutic targets for AAA, the current proposal will investigate the pathological roles of aldosterone (Aldo), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and high salt intake in AAA. Elevated plasma Aldo and high salt intake have been linked to a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. MR antagonists have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure. However, little is known of the roles of Aldo, MR, and high sal intake in AAA. Recently, the applicants discovered that administration of MR agonists, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) or Aldo to C57BL/6 male mice induced AAA in the presence of high salt. Importantly, DOCA- or Aldo-salt-induced AAA mimicked human AAA with respect to oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, smooth muscle cell (SMC) degeneration, metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, and elastin degradation. Treatment of mice with spironolactone or eplerenone, two clinically used MR antagonists, effectively attenuated DOC- or Aldo-salt-induced aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. Building on these exciting and novel findings, the applicants further demonstrated that, in isolated mouse aorta, administration of pathological plasma concentrations of Aldo and sodium activated MMP2 and induced oxidative stress, suggesting a direct pathological effect of Aldo and salt on aorta. Interestingly,
denuding endothelial cells from isolated aorta had no effect on Aldo-salt-induced MMP2 activation and oxidative stress, indicating that MR in SMC (SMC-MR) is involved. Consistent with this concept, the applicants found that p47phox, a component of NADPH oxidase that has been implicated in human AAA, was markedly upregulated by Aldo-salt in the medial layer of abdominal aortic wall and co-localized with SMC a-Actin, which was completely abolished by treatment of mice with eplerenone. Moreover, treatment of mice with temporal, a free radical scavenger, diminished DOCA-salt-induced AAA. Therefore, the applicants hypothesize that increased plasma Aldo and salt activate SMC-MR and p47phox and thus result in oxidative stress, MMP activation, vascular inflammation, SMC degeneration, and elastin degradation, thereby contributing to AAA. Three specific aims are: 1) test the hypothesis that SMC-MR is required for Aldo-salt-induced AAA; 2) define the mechanism by which SMC-MR targets p47phox to induce AAA; 3) determine whether targeting the Aldo/MR/salt axis is effective for treatment of AAA. To achieve these aims, genetic animal models (SMC- specific MR knockout mice and global p47phox knockout mice) and various molecular, biochemical, and physiopathological approaches will be used. If proposed studies are successful, they will have a profound impact on current basic researches and clinical practices on the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of AAA.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION:    
Background: Traumatic brain injury has been referred to as the signature injury of the Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) wars. Over 25,000 soldiers were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in 2012 alone. Not only do soldiers have blast-related mTBI, estimates of comorbid Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), range from 11% to 50%. Since neural mechanisms affected by mTBI and PTSD often are overlapping, it is suggested that mTBI and PTSD may have an additive effect on symptoms. Indeed, an estimated 44-50% of soldiers with mTBI/PTSD remain symptomatic after one-year, compared to an estimated 10% in sports related concussion. Both mTBI and PTSD are associated with deficits in executive functioning. Additional factors that accompany mTBI in combat Veterans are depression and sleep deficits. Consequently, the combination of all these factors, impact executive functions and result in combat Veterans who are struggling to live productive lives. An effective treatment of executive function is needed for
Veterans diagnosed with mTBI. Goal Management Training (GMT) is a metacognitive intervention that has been validated in TBI. However, limitations in GMT studies raise questions regarding effectiveness of GMT in mTBI. Based on preliminary data, GMT improved significantly on a problem solving measure in Veterans with blast-related mTBI, but lacked transfer to everyday activities. Therefore, we developed a Smartphone application to enhance the transfer of GMT skills to everyday tasks. The purpose: of this randomized study is to determine the effect of an innovative treatment for executive functions, enhanced with Smartphone technology, in Veterans with multiple blast related mTBI. In addition to determining the overall benefit of GMT, the study will investigate the influence of comorbid factors, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep disorders and cognitive capacity. Method: Veterans diagnosed with repeat blast-related mTBI and executive function deficit will be recruited from two sites (Tampa and North Florida/South Georgia) by Speech Services. Veterans will be randomized to GMT (38 participants) or to a control treatment called Brain Health Workshop (BHW) (16 participants).The Tower of London, a measure of planning and problem solving will be used to determine response to treatment. Primary analysis will use two sample t-test to compare group A (intervention) and group B (control) on improvements in time to completion on the TOL. In addition, as an exploratory analysis, we will perform a regression analysis that includes treatment group, PTSD severity and their interaction as independent variables, to adjust for PTSD severity measured by Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and to investigate whether there is interaction between treatment group and PTSD severity. Additional, exploratory tertiary analysis using paired t-tests will determine whether treatment effect generalizes to executive function performance in everyday activities (BRIEF-A) or engagement in community participation (CRIS). To test the second specific aim, a general linear regression will be used to determine whether factors such as PTSD, sleep, depression or cognitive capacity is associated with response to treatment. Results: If the results support the hypothesis that GMT will improve executive functions than this cognitive intervention can be adapted to a tele-health method of delivery and tested in a larger clinical trial. Moreover, the influence of the four factors on response to treatment, can guide future studies to determine which patients are likely to benefit from GMT.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated Na+ channelopathies are associated with multiple disorders. Mutations in neuronal Na+ channels cause epilepsy syndromes, ataxia, and autism; mutations in the cardiac Na+ channels are associated with arrhythmias, sudden infant death syndrome, conduction disorders, and cardiomyopathies. A hotspot for disease-causing mutations is the channels' C-terminal domain (CTD), which harbors a calmodulin (CaM) interaction site. Because Ca2+ is the ultimate signal of electrical activity and is often perturbed
in disease states, the presence of a key Ca2+ sensor (CaM) at a hotspot for channel regulation (the CTD) provides a starting point for understanding how these channelopathies cause disease. Nevertheless, regulation of Na+ channels by Ca2+/CaM is poorly understood and information is limited by the lack of structural information and challenges to investigating channel function in native cell types. Here, we build on new structural information and novel methods to investigate how Ca2+/CaM regulates Na+ channels in the context of native cell types. Our new structural information provides background and guideposts for investigating how Ca2+-free (apo) CaM and Ca2+-loaded CaM differently affect channel function; how neuronal and cardiac channels are distinctly regulated by CaM in their native cell types, and how different CaM interacting domains within Na+ channels contribute to overall Ca2+/CaM-dependent regulation. Our novel methods of studying informative mutants in cardiomyocytes and neurons will provide an understanding of how Ca2+ affects Na+ channels and thus how Ca2+ dysregulation leads to the various Na+ channelopathies. The specific Aims addressed in this proposal are to determine: 1) How Ca2+-free apoCaM controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes; 2) How Ca2+/CaM interaction with the NaV CTD controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes; and 3) How Ca2+/CaM interaction with the NaV III-IV intracellular linker controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein kinase C-delta (PKCd) is a signal-regulated enzyme that plays pleotropic roles in the control of cardiac contraction, ventricular remodeling, ischemia-reperfusion injury and cardioprotection. PKCd is traditionally viewed as an allosterically-activated enzyme that exerts membrane-delimited actions at lipid membranes. This conventional model of PKCd activation does not adequately explain PKCd's actions in the heart, where PKCd phosphorylates proteins in non-membrane compartments and exerts diverse (and in some cases opposing) actions in both ischemic injury and cardioprotection. Our previous studies began to address this longstanding dilemma by showing that PKCd is activated in a stimulus-specific manner in cardiomyocytes. We showed that PKCd is phosphorylated at Y311 in cardiomyocytes subjected to oxidative stress (but not G protein-coupled receptor agonists) and that Y311 phosphorylation alters PKCd activity toward the sarcomeric regulatory proteins cardiac troponin I and cardiac troponin T. New data in this application expose the mechanism underlying the Y311-phosphorylation dependent change in PKCd's enzymology. We show that Y311 phosphorylation generates a docking site for PKCd's phospho-Tyr (pY) binding C2 domain. The C2 domain-pY311 interaction in turn controls PKCd activity indirectly by regulating phosphorylation at a novel site (S357) in the catalytic pocket of the kinase domain. The redox-dependent decrease in PKCd-S357 phosphorylation leads to a high level of lipid-independent activity (allowing for the phosphorylation of substrates throughout the cell, not just on lipid membranes) and a change in PKCd's substrate phosphoacceptor site (P-site) specificity. A mechanism to dynamically alter P-site specificity (through a change in kinase domain phosphorylation) is both novel for PKCd and unprecedented for any other kinase. Studies in this application will consider changes in S357 phosphorylation as a mechanism to explain PKCd's distinctive cellular actions during oxidative stress. Aim #1 will use in vitro biochemical approaches to identify the role of the C2 domain and S357 phosphorylation in the control of PKCd signaling to pathways that regulate cardiac growth and apoptosis responses. We will use biochemical approaches to identify growth factor- and ROS-dependent mechanisms that regulate PKCd-S357 phosphorylation and take advantage of genetic approaches and overexpression strategies (including with analogue-sensitive forms of PKCd) to identify substrates/effectors that are uniquely activated by distinct molecular forms of PKCd and (in conjunction with studies Aim 2) examine their role in cardiac injury responses. Aim #2 will use mouse models engineered to express mutant PKCdS357A or PKCdS357E alleles, in place of the WT-PKCd allele, to determine the role of PKCd- S357 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in cardiac function and cardiac pathogenesis following ischemia- reperfusion injury in vivo. The overarching goal of these studies is to identify novel molecular determinant of PKCd that can be targeted to prevent or mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury and pathologic cardiac remodeling.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to antigens, activated B cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) to enhance antibody diversity. SHM and CSR each require the Activation Induced Deaminase (AID), which catalyses DNA-specific cytidine deaminase activity. AID targets the highly repetitive switch (S) regions of immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) loci to induce DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which are intermediates in CSR. When targeting to variable (V) region exons of IgH and IgL loci, AID predominantly induces point mutations, termed SHM, resulting in the increased affinity of antibody for antigen. Intensive efforts have identified potential AID co-factors, which could bind S region DNA or RNA transcripts of Igh loci. This suggests a link between AID targeting and transcriptional pausing or RNA processing of S regions.  In contrast to the relatively well studied
targeting mechanisms for CSR, the mechanism of AID targeting to V region locus is much less well understood. Although AID has the ability to deaminate any transcribed substrate in vitro and could potentially access the genome widely to induce genomic instability in B cells, its physiological targets during SHM are almost exclusively restricted to V regions of Ig loci. However, due to the lack of robust experimental systems, it remains largely unknown how AID is specifically targeted to V regions, which is one of the most interesting unresolved questions in
the field of AID regulation. Thus, we have established a unique experimental system, and propose to address these fundamental questions. The completion of our proposal will provide novel insights into the regulation of AID-mediated SHM in B cell immune responses and elucidate molecular mechanism of genomic instability in B cell lymphomas.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantifying Environmental Variables Affecting Airborne Influenza Transmission In most temperate climates, influenza prevails in cold, dry winter months. However, in some temperate and tropical regions, influenza epidemicity is correlated with extremes of precipitation, not dryness, and can circulate at low levels essentially
year-round or appear in uni- or bi-modal annual outbreaks. How environmental variables affect influenza circulation in the human population remains poorly understood, in part because the science behind airborne respiratory virus transmission crosses disciplinary boundaries between the biomedical and physical sciences, encompassing fields as diverse as virology, physiology, epidemiology, fluid mechanics, aerosol science, and climatology. Here we seek to understand how individual environmental variables - such as temperature, humidity, and airflow - cumulatively affect the transmission probability of influenza viruses in a representative mammalian experimental system. The theoretical framework behind these studies is a novel quantitative model, based upon data gathered in experimental guinea pigs, which attempts to characterize the impact of the environment on influenza virus transmission between infected and susceptible hosts. This project bridges the gap between virology and engineering in bringing together three co- investigators with relevant and complementary skill sets: Dr. Nicole Bouvier, a physician-scientist with extensive experience in the transmission of influenza viruses among guinea pigs; Dr. William Ristenpart, an engineer with expertise in the application of high-speed imaging technologies to investigations of complex fluid dynamics; and Dr. Anthony Wexler, an authority on aerosol transport who has developed novel techniques for high-resolution imaging of aerosol deposition in the rodent respiratory tract. Our preliminary theoretical modeling has generated innovative interpretations of the experimental data, yielding three testable hypotheses, which form the basis of this proposal: (1) Influenza virus transmission probability will decrease with increased airflow speed, (2) transmission probability will decrease with the degree of turbulence, and (3) transmission probability will increase with the time integral of the viral concentration within the inoculated animal. Rigorously controlled laboratory studies, designed to isolate a single variable for analysis while others are held constant, will provide a quantitative framework for understanding the cumulative effects of temperature, humidity, airflow velocity, turbulence, and position on the transmission of human influenza viruses in a relevant animal model. Quantifying these environmental variables, individually and cumulatively, will enable their extrapolation to larger environments and time scales, with the potential to transform our understanding of the epidemiology of seasonal and pandemic influenza.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central scientific question of this competing proposal's renewal is finding novel functions of immunologically relevant genes by means of classical genetic analysis in genetically diverse wild-derived mice. We have shown and continue to show that, with respect to regulation of immune responses, wild-derived mice resemble human phenotype better than classical laboratory mice. One line of inquiry continues investigation of TIRAP-dependent activation of IRAK2 followed by specific recruitment of the p38 MAP kinase, which is hyperactivated in wild- derived but not laboratory mice. We have proposed a model of MyD88-independent recruitment of IRAK2 and TIRAP in wild-derived mice, which leads to a specific activation of p38. If confirmed, this model will challenge several well-established paradigms such as simultaneous activation of MAP kinases via TLRs and MyD88- dependent activation of p38 thus broadening existing models of TLR-mediated activation and providing additional mechanistic insight. Another phenotype that we propose to investigate in wild-derived mice is their remarkable resistance to TNF-induced lethality, which is, according to our preliminary data, a genetic trait that is conferred by four loci, which we propose to identify. Given our expertise and track record in mapping and positional cloning, it is likely that we will find novel components of TNF-receptor pathway, which protect mice and presumably humans from TNF-induced lethality. To explain the trait, we generated our central hypothesis in that TNF-resistance in MSM mice is biased towards pro-survival as compared to cytotoxic signaling that leads to necrosis, and we provide feasible scientific plan to prove that. Thus, the scientific impact of this proposal is high because it will identify component, which are capable of defining the outcome of TNF-activation. In addition, the proposed genetic analysis will help identifying genes that otherwise would be difficult to predict in the absence of  strong educated guess. Most importantly, the identification of these genes will be of high relevance to human health given several hundred thousand of patients suffering each year from septic shock. In addition to cloning of the TNF-resistance, which is clearly a priority of this proposal, we provide a research plan aimed at revealing in vivo functions of two genes that we identified in the previous cycle. ) )]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Hippo signaling pathway is a fundamental regulator of organ growth and homeostasis. Specifically, the downstream effector of this pathway, Yap (and its homolog Taz), has been implicated in the maintenance of stem cells and in the regulation of liver size. Although under normal physiological conditions, hepatocytes serve as the main source of cell replenishment in the liver, certain surgical and chemical injury conditions have been shown to cause the expansion of atypical ductal progenitor cells. In previously published work, we have shown that modifications in Yap expression can reprogram hepatocyte to a ductal phenotype, however the nature of how Yap activity regulates biliary ductal progenitors in native conditions within the liver is currently unknown. I have shown that Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), one of the most widely characterized targets of the hippo-signaling pathway and a bona-fide reporter for Yap transcriptional activity, is expressed heterogeneously in ductal progenitor cells in the liver. Additionally, I have shown that Yap activity is required for organoid initiation and growth in three-dimensional cultures. Finally, I have also shown that Yap activity is upregulated in expanded ductal cells after chemical injury. The overarching goal of this proposal is therefore to investigate how Yap and Taz regulate and maintain liver ductal progenitor cells. It also hopes to identify the role of Yap and Taz in the ductal response to well-established liver injury models. Through my continued research on this project, I hope to take advantage of all of the resources available to me at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard University. Additionally, I hope to continue developing as a scientist and gathering knowledge in the area of tissue regeneration and organ maintenance. As can be seen in the work I have already performed for this proposal and for the work that I will continue to do,
I am committed to a scientific career where I will be devoted to advancing basic science to directly impact human health. This proposed work will hopefully contribute to a broader understanding of cellular maintenance in the liver and the mechanism by which the liver responds to injury. The isolation and examination of liver progenitor cells that can be cultured indefinitely in-vitro (and the downstream mechanisms by which these cells are maintained), may also pave the way for cellular therapies for liver disease. Additionally, this work may help furthe our understanding of the basic processes and cellular maintenance required for the upkeep of a vital organ in our bodies.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the RFA-HL-13-027: Functional Assays to Screen Genomic Hits (R21/R33). In the past 15 years over 40 genetic loci have been identified as associated with increased risk for cardiac arrhythmia and/or sudden cardiac death with Mendelian and multigenic inheritance. With the advance of rapid clinical genetic testing and Next-Generation sequencing, the number of mutations/variants has grown to greater than 1000 for the top loci alone (LQT1-3). A large majority of these variants have not been functionally phenotyped however. This poses a considerable dilemma for the clinical geneticist and managing cardiologist-are uncharacterized variants/mutations to be treated as true risks for arrhythmia? This decision is critical because therapy includes life-long medication, behavioral modification and often implantation of cardiac defibrillators. Moreover, these management decisions extend to all other family members harboring the variants. Furthermore, these clinical scenarios will soon become increasingly common as rapid, accessible and affordable whole exome/genome takes its place in the clinical arena. Till now, functional phenotyping of new variants has been performed in piecemeal fashion, with reports of one or a handful of variants at a time. This usually takes place as a side-project for investigators who are pursuing other aspects of cardiac biology. We propose to functionally phenotype all of the disease-associated genetic variants and most of the rare polymorphisms that have appeared in genetic databases for the loci most commonly reported for hereditary arrhythmias. Variants will be created in cDNAs for expression in human cell lines. Functional expression will be assessed with a high-throughput electrophysiology system. Subsequently, those variants exhibiting a loss-of-function phenotype will be further assayed for surface trafficking defects by biochemical analysis. We will create a publically available database with both ongoing and completed results that will allow other investigators to provide input. Creation of this public resource will provide 
clinical geneticist and managing physicians a valuable resource to fully analyze the results from genetic testing of their patients. Successful competition of this project will provide a framework and resource for investigators in the field and have immediate impact on clinical management of an increasing number of patients. Accordingly we believe that this proposal is in the spirit of both the RFA-HL- 13-027 and the mission of the NIH/NHLBI.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During hematopoiesis, descendants of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) become committed to differentiate along specific cell lineages, eventually acquiring the characteristics of terminally differentiated cells. The identification and isolation f HSC has advanced substantially over the past few decades, however, the mechanisms that regulate stem cell lineage commitment and differentiation are still obscure. Steady-state hematopoiesis relies on the tight regulation of apoptosis pathways for the development, maintenance and function of the hematopoietic system. In Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph- MPN), dysregulation of cell death pathways is frequently observed, implicating cell death factors as potential initiators of disease and targets for therapeutic intervention.  Recent studies have highlighted the importance of apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) in human malignancies, however, a functional role of ARC in normal hematopoiesis has not been investigated. We hypothesize that ARC plays a critical role in normal blood stem cell and myeloid differentiation. Utilizing an ARC-deficient (ARC -/-) mouse model we will investigate ARC function in hematopoiesis.  Our preliminary studies revealed that aged ARC -/- mice exhibit anemia and thrombocytopenia. Investigation of ARC -/- spleens showed splenomegaly with a tri-lineage expansion of myeloid cells, megakaryocyte hyperplasia, and an increase in immature cells consistent with myeloproliferation and extramedullary hematopoiesis. ARC -/- bone marrow revealed increased reticulin staining and reduced cell numbers consistent with marrow fibrosis. The hematopoietic findings in ARC -/- mice are consistent with a Ph- MPN resembling primary myelofibrosis. Further analysis showed expansion of the HSC compartment in ARC -/- bone marrow and in vitro assays revealed altered HSC differentiation capacity in methylcellulose colony assays. Additionally, the myeloproliferative disease in ARC -/- mice is transplantable into lethally irradiated congenic recipients.  This projects aims to elucidate the role of ARC in HSC function, myeloid differentiation, and Ph- MPN. To characterize ARC in lineage commitment of stem and progenitor cells, as well as, myeloid differentiation and Ph- MPN cells, we will utilize genetic murine models, stem cell transplant assays, Ph- MPN patient samples and restoration of ARC levels in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism of ARC, we will use transcriptional profiling to guide our investigation and identify molecular pathways critical to ARC function.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the absence of an effective vaccine, administration of antiretroviral drugs prior to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exposure (pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP) may be a reliable method to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection. Daily oral tenofovir and FTC (Truvada) is currently approved for use as PrEP in high-risk individuals but has had limited success in human clinical trials to date, mainly due to adherence issues.  Rilpivirine (RPV) is the most recent reverse transcriptase inhibitor approved for antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1. Drug-resistant mutations detected in patients failing RPV-containing regimens conferred mainly low-level resistance to RPV and RPV is active against most mutants selected by other drugs. RPV has been formulated into injectable long-acting nanoparticles (RPV-LA) for use as long-lasting PrEP to be administered by healthcare providers. Development of resistance or transmission of RPV-resistant variants during PrEP has not been previously addressed, particularly their impact on subsequent ART. A case has recently been described of a woman who became HIV-1-infected during RPV-LA treatment and subsequently developed RPV-resistant virus in the presence of sub-therapeutic plasma RPV concentration. We propose to investigate vaginal transmission of wild-type (WT) HIV-1 and drug-resistant variants in the presence and absence of therapeutic and subtherapeutic concentrations of RPV-LA PrEP or Truvada, using a novel animal model that will also allow us to investigate the dynamics of infection and dissemination in the female genital tract in real-time.  Using an innovative new reporter virus system and a well-characterized humanized mouse model, we hypothesize that a prevalent HIV-1 mutant resistant to both RPV and Truvada (E138K/M184I) will be transmitted in the absence of drug and in the presence of Truvada PrEP, but will lead to an abortive infection of local CD4+ target cells in the genital trac in the presence of therapeutic RPV-LA concentrations. However, transmission or development of drug-resistant HIV-1 will lead to faster virologic failure during subsequent ART.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
Toxoplasma gondii can cause fatal infections in persons who are immunocompromised by AIDS. Patients with AIDS are especially vulnerable because there is no effective therapy against an established chronic infection of T. gondii. The paucity of effective therapeutics against T. gondii chronic infection in AIDS patients stems largely from the fact that few in vivo cyst drug targets have been identified. Our primary goal in studying T. gondii is to understand the molecular basis by which it causes disease to identify proteins that can be targeted to prevent T. gondii cyst development and/or maintenance. Using next generation sequencing methods, we have identified novel mechanisms of post-transcriptional RNA regulation during T. gondii chronic infection. We have seen that two of the 37 T. gondii CCCH zinc finger genes are more than 100- fold upregulated from acute to chronic infection. CCCH zinc finger proteins bind to and regulate mRNA abundance, and have been shown to control stage-specific development in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. For this proposal, we will perform a mechanistic analysis of these two chronic infection-specific CCCH zinc finger proteins during chronic infection establishment and/or maintenance. In the first aim, we will determine the intracellular localization of these proteins as well as their RNA, DNA and protein-binding partners. In the second aim, we will use RNA-seq to define the potential mRNAs that these CCCH zinc finger proteins regulate. Successful completion of our synergistic yet independent aims will produce both potential mechanisms and new candidate target mRNAs for these zinc finger proteins. We are optimistic that these studies will provide new drug targets for pharmaceutical intervention against chronic T. gondii infections in AIDS patients.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION: Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death and hospitalization throughout the Western World. Reperfusion therapy with fibrinolytic agents has significantly reduced early mortality from acute myocardial infarction and disability from stroke. Despite efforts to enhance the fibrin specificity of genetically engineered fibrinolytic agents, significan bleeding risks have prompted the development of alternative pharmacologic and device approaches for reperfusion. We propose a targeted drug delivery system to improve efficacy and safety. We will engineer a tissue-targeted, filamentous platform technology to deliver inhibitors of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Tissue-specific inhibition of PAI-1 is expected to reduce thrombus burden and vessel reocclusion, while minimizing adverse effects (hemorrhage), and thus improve net clinical benefit. The filamentous structure of the drug carrier has favorable flow dynamics promoting vessel wall and thrombus accumulation, thereby enhancing local endogenous fibrinolysis with reduced bleeding risk. This technology is expected to yield a formulation with high thrombus-specificity and efficacy that will outperform systemic antibody- or small molecule inhibitor-based therapies. A combination of in vitro and in vivo assays will be performed to gain insights into the dynamics of clot-specificity, drug release, efficacy, and potential bleeding risk. A combination of in vivo intravital microscopy, ex vivo imaging, and quantitative tissue analysis will provide detailed information on the efficiency of targeting nanoparticles and PAI-1 inhibitors to the thrombus. We will address whether the nanotherapy improves localized treatment by promoting endogenous fibrinolysis secondary to PAI-1 inhibition and thereby limiting thrombus burden. We will examine the effect of nanotherapy versus free drugs on thrombus growth/stability and carotid artery occlusion time. The effect of PAI-1 inhibition on hemostasis (i.e. tail bleeding time) and blood loss will be assessed. This approach represents a radical shift from current targeting strategies. Nanomedicines targeting the vessel wall could have a significant clinical impact in atherothrombosis, venous thromboembolism, restenosis, and transplant vasculopathy.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

The proposal is truly translational, as it draws from clinical observation and moves
towards rigorous quantification of biomarkers of cognitive impairment in both mouse
models and patients. Such a study will serve as a model for studies of other
neurodevelopmental disorders in our comprehensive Center. These biomarkers can then, in
future studies, be directly related to gene expression. First, we will identify a mechanism-based
electrophysiological biomarker of cognitive dysfunction and potential responsiveness to
treatment in a genetically well-defined syndrome highly associated with ID. Standardized
measures of cognition are limited in their ability to quantify subtle individual differences or to
capture clinical heterogeneity that may inform prognosis and intervention. Our group has
considerable expertise in the integration of EEG biomarkers with behavior to better characterize
children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Second, we will perform parallel studies in mouse
models, in order to validate and better understand the genetic basis of biomarker identified in
humans and to begin to test treatments that may alter both the cell activation patterns and
behavior in these mouse models. Specifically we will test how abnormal oscillations disrupt
information flow in awake behaving animals, allowing us to directly link electrophysiological
changes to cognition.
Innovative methods to study electrophysiological markers in both mouse models and
patients. The human EEG experiments in the Jeste Lab will make use of new analysis
techniques to measure signal complexity and to quantify resting state spectral power from
challenging populations. The mouse experiments will make use of custom-made high density
electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of neurons with silicon probes targeted to
multiple cortical regions. New attention-based multimodal set shifting task designed in the
Golshani lab to record the activity of large neuronal populations during flexible decision making
and attentional set shifting, a cognitive domain that is affected in the disorder. Finally, we will
use a new generation of miniaturized microscopes to record the activity patterns of large
populations of hippocampal neurons over days during learning, allowing us for the first time to
follow population dynamics in the same group of neurons during learning and extinction.
Importantly, these studies are rooted in gaining a new understanding of ID at a systems level
with a desire to find convergence in mechanisms and evidence-based treatments for individuals
with this heterogeneous group of disorder.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagasic Cardiomyopathy (CCM) caused by the intracellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the endemic regions of Latin America with an estimated 15 million infected with or are carriers of the disease. Globalization has increased the risk of Chagas disease in developed countries including North America, Europe and Australia. We demonstrated that elevated cholesterol increased the rate of T. cruzi invasion and that this parasite utilizes LDLr to invade host cells. Parasite invasion was associated with a significant increase in the levels of LDL in organs such as heart, liver and adipose tissue. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated altered lysosomal pH and function during acute infection. Increased fatty acid (FA) and cholesterol metabolism was observed in the hearts of infected mice. Transmission electron microscopy revealed altered mitochondria, ER and sarcomeres in the heart of infected mice. Whole body lipid homeostasis depends on diet, lipid biosynthesis and clearance of liver and lipolysis and adipogenesis of adipose tissue. We have documented there is a better survival rate for high fat diet (HFD) mice during acute infection with the reduced rate of lipolysis; however, the surviving mice developed cardiac dysfunction with dysfunctional mitochondria and altered lipid homeostasis at later stages of infection and fat necrosis. Acute infection caused fatty liver with increased cholesterol accumulation and inflammation. Cholesterol, triglyceride, FA and glucose metabolism are significantly altered in the liver of infected mice. Our observations suggest that T. cruzi infection alters systemic and whole body lipid homeostasis for parasite survival at different stages of infection and modulates the function of heart by increased adipogenesis and lipogenesis in the myocardium during infection. Based on these observations we hypothesize that the elevated intracellular lipid levels during invasion and acute infection, and the demand for cholesterol biosynthesis during chronic infection may exhaust intracellular ER and mitochondrial oxidative capacity and thus contribute to the development of CCM. Also, we believe a significant correlation between the host lipid levels (diet, serum lipid profile, lipid biosynthesis and clearance of liver and adipocyte) and the progression of CCM exist. In order to fully appreciate the role of lipid homeostasis in the development of human CCM, novel transgenic mice models  huApo-B and FAT-ATTAC will be used to demonstrate the link between diet/serum lipids/adipocyte and CCM. Understanding the factors responsible for chronic CCM will aid in the development of new approaches to prevent progression of chagasic heart disease. In addition, this proposal will provide important data on the potential interactions
of the epidemics of obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia due to demographic and epidemiologic transition to a western diet in Chagas endemic regions that can result in changes in the pathophysiology of Chagas Disease.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Using structural approaches (cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography), we will investigate the mechanisms used by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to enter host cells by engaging two receptors (decay accelerating factor and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor). CVB3 is a human pathogen that causes myocarditis, pancreatitis, and has been implicated in the onset of juvenile diabetes mellitus. Our proposed studies of CVB3 entry are a continuation of a productive collaboration with Dr. Jeffery Bergelson, Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital at Philadelphia. A combination of traditional and innovative methods will be used to visualize both receptor binding and the resulting conformational changes that lead to entry and uncoating. Of particular interest is a novel entry intermediate that has never been observed (Aim 1). This particle has been isolated with fingerlike density projections extruding from the capsid, and these densities are hypothesized to be peptides used to anchor the particle to the host membrane. We will investigate the capability of this new particle (and other entry intermediates) to bind receptors and infect the host. In addition to conventional structural studies made with purified virus and recombinant receptor proteins in solution (Aim 2), the full-length receptor will be anchored onto a lipid bilayer disc to form virus-receptor complexes for an in situ asymmetric study (Aim 3). This
approach simulates the physiological binding event, in which the virus interacts with receptors at a single, focused region on its capsid. Preliminary results with this asymmetric approach suggest the virus behaves differently when interacting with a few membrane-bound receptors compared to many soluble receptors. Specifically our in situ A-particle retains an intact genome (as the A-particle does in an infection) and undergoes different protein rearrangements compared to particles that are treated with soluble receptors or heat. The proposed study is directed at understanding the structural alterations that an enterovirus capsid must undergo to uncoat after successfully finding and attaching to the receptor in situ.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human V?9V?2  T cells are the major subset of ?? T cells that are found in human blood, comprising up to 5% of the T cells in healthy individuals and expanding to 20-50% during infection or disease. These cells play important roles in mediating immunity against microbial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae (the causative agents of tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively), and can respond potently against certain types of tumor cells. V?9V?2 T cells respond to these threats through recognition of structurally related non-peptidic phosphorylated antigens (pAgs). In tumor cells these are intermediate metabolites that accumulate due to over-production of the mevalonate pathway and in microbes they are generated during isoprenoid biosynthesis. It is largely unknown how V?9V?2 T cells recognize these pAgs; this proposal seeks to improve our overall understanding of the mechanisms behind V?9V?2 T cell activation and improve our ability to modulate this population in clinical settings. These cells also represent a prime opportunity to study alternative recognition strategies by ?? T cells, as classical and most no-classical MHC molecules do not appear to be involved in the recognition process. Our collaborators were the first to define the role of the BTN3A molecules in pAg-mediated V?9V?2 T cell stimulation and we have since then demonstrated the intracellular domain of one on them, BTN3A1, is the molecular sensor for pAg accumulation. We seek to understand the events that occur after pAg binding in our Aim1: To determine the direct molecular consequences of pAg binding to the BTN3A1 B30.2 intracellular domain. by using structural and dynamic studies including crystallography, NMR and fluorescence based measurements (FRET). In our Aim 2. To determine the supra-molecular organization of BTN3A1 molecules in the plasma membrane upon pAg or 20.1 mAb binding and its role in V?9V?2 T cell activation, we will use FRET based approaches, microscopy and protein engineering to study the factors that mediate cell surface assembly of BTN3A molecules. Finally, we will employ cross-linking and pull-downs combined with a SILAC-based mass spectrometry approach, complemented with a high-throughput genome-wide knockdown screen to pursue our Aim 3. From BTN3A1 to the V?9V?2 TCR: discovery of the relevant molecular players linking BTN3A1 to V?9V?2 T cell activation, which will define the other molecular players that are involved in pAg recognition in inducing the signals that directly lead to V?9V?2 T cell activation.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have a 2-3 fold increased risk of myocardial infarction compared to members of the general population. Traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors alone do not accurately predict CVD in RA patients and therefore adequate primary prevention strategies are lacking. Systemic inflammation from active RA is strongly associated with CV risk in RA patients, but mechanisms by which inflammation increases CV morbidity and mortality are poorly understood. High density lipoprotein (HDL) is an anti-atherogenic molecule that regulates systemic inflammation by promoting cholesterol efflux and preventing oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL). We have previously demonstrated that HDL function is impaired and significantly associated with both disease activity and systemic inflammation, in patients with RA. We further showed that active RA leads to oxidative and protein changes in HDL resulting in dysfunctional HDL. Oxidized low density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of RA through signaling via the lectin-like ox-LDL receptor 1 (LOX- 1) in the joint synovium. Our preliminary results suggest that modulation of HDL function by increasing HDL's ability to prevent oxidation of LDL is associated with improvement in arthritis activity. We hypothesize that modulation of HDL function represents a novel pathway through which to both decrease arthritis activity and improve CV risk in patients with RA. We will test our hypothesis under two specific aims. In aim 1, we will evaluate whether modulation of HDL function using HDL mimetic peptides can reduce atherosclerosis and joint inflammation in a recently established mouse model of RA. We will also modulate HDL function by paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene deletion and overexpression to evaluate the effects on arthritis activity and atherosclerosis in this model. In aim 2, we will determine whether abnormal HDL function contributes to increased CV risk in a carefully characterized, prospective cohort of over 200 RA patients using in vitro assays of HDL function and targeted HDL proteomics and lipidomics. CV risk will be assessed by the progression of carotid atherosclerosis over three year follow-up and by carotid plaque inflammation using positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET). The results of this work may identify important mechanisms through which inflammation increases CV risk in RA patients, and thereby determine new markers for risk assessment and specific targets for intervention.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has become a major epidemic in today's society. It is a major risk factor for cardiac disease and necessitates studies that enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in transcriptional adaptation to obesity that could potentially translate into therapeutic targets. A contributing factor in obesity is hypothyroidism. Many of the confounding cardiac effects of obesity overlap with effects of hypothyroidism including mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted cardiac energetics, and ultimately decreased cardiac contractility. The heart requires highly efficient metabolism to maintain the levels of ATP needed for contractility and pump function. We identified a signaling pathway for transcriptional regulation in the heart by MED13 and found that this pathway plays a key role in modulating energy homeostasis. Our preliminary studies for this proposal show that altering cardiac transcription by MED13 significantly alters metabolic gene expression, metabolite production and cardiac function, prompting us to develop the necessary tools to identify the mechanism for MED13 function in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this application is to decipher the physiological role of MED13-dependent transcriptional regulation of cardiac reprograming in response to obesity and altered thyroid hormone levels. We hypothesize that MED13 functions to inhibit cardiac transcriptional reprogramming in obesity and hypothyroidism. The specific Aims designed to test this hypothesis using MED13 gain- and loss-of-function mice are: Aim 1: To analyze the molecular mechanistic action for MED13 regulation of cardiac energetics in response to obesity. The experiments planned will test the hypothesis that MED13 integrates metabolic signaling events in the heart, functioning as a brake to regulate transcriptional reprogramming. We will utilize in vivo and in vitro models of obesity to assess changes in cardiac gene expression, mitochondrial function, metabolomics profile and key signaling pathways that are regulated by MED13. Aim 2: To define MED13- dependent regulation of cardiac remodeling in response to chronic hypothyroidism. The proposed experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that MED13 suppresses transcriptional reprograming in response to chronic hypothyroidism. We will utilize a similar experimental approach as in Aim 1 to dissect MED13-dependent cardiac effects of TH signaling in vitro and in vivo. These studies will provide mechanistic insights into the regulatory network linking cardiac reprograming in obesity and hypothyroidism. The new insights will provide opportunities for therapeutic modulation of cardiac diseases with disrupted transcriptional programing, altered cardiac energetics and decreased function. .]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

degree of language impairment. Thus, (i) auditory encoding latency (M100) discriminates ASD versus non-
ASD; (ii) auditory change detection latency (mismatch field, MMF) predicts severity of language impairment
in ASD and in other groups with a developmental disability; and (iii) lexical distinction (word versus non-word
low-frequency neural oscillatory activity) both predicts language impairment as well as atypical hemispheric
specialization for language in ASD and, perhaps, in other neurodevelopmental groups. Prior imaging studies of
ASD (including our own) have focused on an intellectually higher-functioning population (high-functioning
autism, or HFA). One reason for this bias is that the majority of imaging studies entail magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), which presupposes a participant's ability to remain motionless during the study, thereby
disqualifying from study the large ASD population with language delay and intellectual disability (possibly as
high as 50%). We seek to investigate the neural basis of autism and associated language and cognitive
impairment in an under-studied population of minimally verbal/non-verbal ASD children (MVNV-ASD, N = 40,
aged 8 to 12 years). To this end, MVNV-ASD encoding, change detection, and lexical MEG measures will be
compared with the same measures already available in age-matched HFA and typically developing (TD)
children. Using the same tasks, MEG data will be obtained from a ?positive control? group of children with
intellectual disability (ID; N =40) but without ASD, matched for age and non-verbal IQ in order to isolate neural
abnormalities specific to MVNV-ASD and not consequent to impairment of general cognitive function. Thus,
our primary goals are: (a) A search for pathogenic mechanisms common to HFA and MVNV-ASD, thereby
enabling a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of disability across the ASD spectrum; and (b) A search
for mechanisms of language impairment that are ASD-specific rather than a consequence of more general
effects of low cognitive ability. To obtain high-quality MEG data, we will deploy a research strategy we
designate ?MEG-PLAN (MEG Protocol for Low-Language/Cognitive Functioning Ability Neuroimaging). The
key elements of MEG-PLAN are: (1) Engage stakeholders (parents/providers) as ?partners in research? to
develop a MEG scanning protocol that maximizes data collection success; (2) Examine automatic brain
responses elicited with passive auditory paradigms, thereby obviating the need for participants to attend to the
task or provide feedback; (3) Remove the need for an individual MRI to localize the MEG signal source by
using a MEG which is registered to an age-appropriate template MRI; (4) Achieve motion tolerance of up to 2
cm via real-time MEG head tracking/motion compensation. This study addresses focus area #2 in the RFA ?

PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC) provides comprehensive and expert analytic tools
for IDDRC users who require support in biostatistics, experimental design and/or the analysis of the large
datasets culled from DNA sequencing and cognate technologies. The Core has 3 components: (1) The
Biostatistics Service, reposed in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, provides support for
experimental design, including the design of clinical trials and the analysis of experimental results. Dr Mary
Putt, Core Director, serves as Vice-Chair of the Graduate Group in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and
Graduate Program Chair for Biostatistics; (2) The Bioinformatics Service supports the analysis of gene
sequences, copy number variants (CNVs) and genome-wide association studies. This effort is reposed in the
Center for Applied Genomics, directed by Dr Hakon Hakonarson, a pioneer in genomics and genome-wide
mapping. (3) The Mitochondrial DNA Analysis Service supports the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
variants through the MitoMap system (http://mitomap.org), a meticulously curated database conceived,
developed and maintained by Dr Douglas Wallace (1). This effort is reposed in the Center for Mitochondrial
and Epigenomic Medicine, which Dr Wallace directs. Drs. Hakonarson and Wallace now join the Intellectual
and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) as Co-Directors of the BBC. The emphasis of the
Core is to assure: (a) Stringent quality control with respect to experimental design and statistical analysis,
thereby assuring that studies are properly controlled, adequately powered, cost-effective and in strict
conformity with all ethical standards; (b) Unfettered and expert access to state-of-the-art bioinformatics
resources for the analysis of genetic data, both nuclear and mitochondrial. Our goal is to make this expertise
available to all IDDRC users, both locally and throughout the IDDRC Network.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The BBC has been developed with careful attention to the overall theme of our
IDDRC ? ?Genes, Brain and Behavior?, or the effort to understand developmental disabilities in three inter-
related domains: (a) The genetic anlage which causes and/or modulates essentially all developmental
disabilities; (b) The biochemical and neurophysiologic alterations which arise from genetic factors; and (c) The
aberrant behaviors which we associate with these genetic and neurophysiologic changes and which we
recognize as the phenotypes of developmental disabilities. The Core is integrated into multiple domains of
biomedical research, from basic science to clinical translational medicine. The BBC will facilitate detailed
understanding of the genetics of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). It will further ensure that
investigations of the phenotypic consequences of these genetic alterations are executed and analyzed
according to scrupulous statistical criteria.
Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia (CHOP)/Penn and to users at other Centers in the Network.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Producing high-affinity antibodies that potently neutralize target pathogens remains a central goal for vaccine research. Many promising vaccine antigens fail to elicit long-lasting protective antibodies due to inefficient generation of
high-affinity memory B cells. While memory B cell development is an active area of research, major gaps remain in our understanding of cognate regulation by CD4+ TH cells and the rules governing ongoing evolution of antigen-specific B cell memory. Research Focus: In these recent studies, we demonstrate that all memory B cell responses require antigen-specific mTH cells. Importantly, direct in situ labeling revealed both Bcl-6+ and Blimp-1+ CD4+ TH cells in the follicular regions of reactive LNs after recall. In support of this observation, using single cell T-qPCR, we demonstrate a transcriptional divide between two tetramer-binding CXCR5+ mTFH compartments with differential expression of Bcl-6 and Prdm-1 at recall. Based on these findings, we propose a division in cognate regulatory function with separable mechanisms used by the different mTFH compartments that may also pre-exist at initial priming. We predict that this division of cognate regulatory function can be targeted to control, remodel and re-assort antigen-specific memory B cell fate at antigen recall with high impact on durable immune protection. Specific Aims: We have developed multi-dimensional single cell strategies to track complex cellular behaviors in vivo and can temporally delete of these two major transcriptional repressors in a cell- specific manner using mixed BM chimeras. We will use this approach: SA-1: to study the molecular control of antigen-specific mTFH differentiation. SA-2: to dissect and modify the mechanisms and GC-regulating function of Bcl-6+ mTFH cells SA-3: to examine the cognate regulatory mechanisms used by Prdm-1+ mTFH cells. Impact: We use polyclonal murine models of protein vaccination with state-of-the-art single cell analyses of antigen-specific
immune function. These high-resolution studies of model antigens have the capacity to shift the basic conceptual framework that surrounds existing vaccine paradigms. Importantly, these basic new principles and assays can be used to re-design contemporary vaccine formulations that optimize high-affinity B cell immunity to more complex antigens.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Free radical-induced damage makes an important contribution to secondary neuronal injury in stroke. No therapy exists at present to prevent or alleviate these effects. The use of catalytic degradation of free radicals is a promising therapeutic approach to address the secondary damage in CNS. Antioxidant enzymes and their low molecular weight mimetics have recently been proposed as potentially powerful therapeutic agents for reducing free radical-induced injury in stroke, and have been shown to be efficient in a number of animal models. However, therapeutic use of these agents for treatment of stroke is limited due to their inability to efficiently penetrate blood-brain barrier. Recently, ability of several targeted nanoparticulate an liposomal constructs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier has been demonstrated. Here, we propose to achieve targeted delivery of a SOD mimetic AEOL 10150 to the site of CNS injury using antibody-coated nanoparticles (NPs) and liposomes. Targeting will be achieved through conjugation of anti-NR1 receptor antibody, which was found to specifically target injured brain parenchyma in our preliminary studies. Our working hypothesis is that enhanced delivery of targeted antioxidant NPs to the site of injury can reduce free radical damage and reduce the degree of secondary neuronal damage in stroke. The strategic goal of this study is to develop a medication for intravenous administration, which could be used as neuroprotective treatment to reduce free radical mediated secondary neuronal damage in stroke. To accomplish this goal, we will first prepare optimized targeted conjugates with maximized binding ability. Experiments with rat cortical neuronal cultures will then be used to evaluate safety and efficacy in vitro, and estimate dosage ranges for animal experiments. Finally, a mouse stroke model will be used for the in vivo evaluation of the efficacy of the proposed therapeutic approach. The short-term goal of this project is to collect in vivo data necessary for translation to a large animal model. In th long term, this research will lead to the development of a novel therapy for treatment/prophylactics of secondary neuronal injury in stroke. More broadly, results of this research will have implications in development new targeting approaches for treatment of various CNS conditions including traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Paul L. Fox, Ph.D., Project Leader
Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of Project 3 is to understand the noncanonical function of an extraordinary tRNA synthetase,
the Glu-Pro tRNA synthetase or EPRS, in diet-induced obesity and consequent cardiovascular disease,
particularly atherosclerosis. The recent explosive epidemic of obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular
disease has begun an unprecedented decline in the health-span of adults in the U.S., and likewise threatens an
equally unprecedented economic burden. In 1942, James Neel suggested a possible rationale for the genetic
selection of genes causing these pathologies. He posited that metabolic pathways were naturally selected to
efficiently store fat and carbohydrate during periods of food scarcity; however, the same genes and pathways
are detrimental during periods of plentiful, calorie-rich food supply as in the Western world today. A kinase
cascade involving the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) is
implicated as a key metabolic pathway regulating food utilization, and is conserved from Drosophila to humans.
Despite intense study, the key downstream effector(s) of mTORC1-S6K1, and consequent cell mechanisms
that regulate metabolism remains unknown. During the previous Project period, we made fundamental in vitro
and in vivo discoveries that revealed phosphorylated EPRS as a key downstream effector of mTORC1-S6K1,
regulating post-transcriptional, inflammation-related pathways in macrophages and metabolic pathways in
adipocytes. Inflammatory macrophages permeate the more abundant adipocytes in adipose tissue of obese
subjects, and EPRS phosphorylation in both cell types by S6K1 might functionally couple these cells, and
contribute importantly to obesity-associated cardiovascular disease. To test the role of phospho-EPRS in these
processes we have generated genetically-modified EPRS phospho-deficient and phospho-mimetic knock-in
mice. Preliminary studies show that phospho-deficient EPRS mice phenocopy S6K1-null mice, e.g., small size
and low fat mass, and will permit rigorous investigation of the role of EPRS in mTORC1-S6K1-driven
mechanisms in vivo. We propose to test the following hypothesis: Phospho-EPRS is a critical effector of the
mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in both adipocytes and macrophages, and contributes importantly to diet-
induced obesity and atherosclerosis. Our discovery that EPRS is a key mTORC1-S6K1 effector activated by
agonists of both inflammation and metabolism provides a molecular link between these processes. We
anticipate our studies will reveal new mechanisms underlying obesity and atherosclerosis, and can provide
novel therapeutic targets for treatment of these related disorders.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This R13 application requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Alcohol and the Nervous System that will take place in February 2016 and 2018 at the historic Hotel Galvez in Galveston, TX. The inaugural GRC on this topic took place in 2014 and was considered a tremendous success by all attendees. This application seeks to build on the success of the first meeting by bringing together young and established alcohol researchers, as well as preeminent scientists from related fields, to discuss the latest groundbreaking developments in neuroscience research on alcohol-related health issues. The central goal will be to foster deep and open discussion of research developments, build new scientific collaborations, and propel the next generation of scientific advances in alcohol neuroscience research. The following four specific aims will ensure that we accomplish this goal: 1) To provide an international forum that promotes open discussion of cutting edge research at the forefront of alcohol effects on the nervous system and related neuroscience areas. 2) To introduce breakthrough neuroscience techniques that facilitate the understanding of brain mechanisms driving alcohol drinking and abuse, as well as mechanisms involved in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. 3) To promote interaction between young and senior investigators and the exchange of ideas that will shape the future directions of the alcohol neuroscience community. 4) To foster the development of the next generation of alcohol researchers by encouraging the participation of students and postdoctoral fellows, both in alcohol and related research fields.  The Alcohol and the Nervous System GRC will focus on presentations and discussions at the forefront of our field. The scope of the research presented will be restricted to basic and clinical studies involving alcohol and the nervous system as well as groundbreaking new neuroscience techniques that can be brought to bear on the greatest challenges facing our field. Talks will address questions centered on the neural substrates that contribute to alcohol-related health disorders across the entire lifespan. The unique GRC format is ideal for breaking down barriers to progress and includes formal talks interspersed with ample discussion time, poster sessions, and informal discussion periods designed to stimulate communication, planning, and collaboration. To foster the growth of the next generation of alcohol researchers, we will put concerted efforts into encouraging and supporting participation of students, postdoctoral fellows and young investigators. Thus, this R13 will foster communication of frontier alcohol research, opportunities for cutting edge scientific collaboration, and entry of new and younger investigators into the alcohol research field. We envision the GRC on Alcohol and the Nervous System will significantly advance our current understanding of the neurobiology of alcohol addiction and stimulate the development of effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of alcohol use disorders.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Jonathan Smith, Ph.D., Core Leader
Project Summary/Abstract
The Lipoprotein analysis portion of this Core's primary objective is to analyze lipid and lipoprotein levels in
various mouse models produced by projects and to provide human lipoproteins as needed. Mouse lipoprotein
analysis will be accomplished using two methods, one based on separation of HDL-C from non-HDL-C via
ultracentrifugation or precipitation, and the other based on size exclusion chromatography by FPLC. The
Atherosclerosis portion of this Core's primary objective is to train investigators how to sacrifice mice and
prepare tissues for atherosclerosis assays, and to offer two separate quantitative atherosclerosis assays; 1)
cross sectional lesion area at the aortic root, and 2) cross sectional brachiocephalic lesion area. We can also
assist Project personnel by teaching them the assay of surface lesion area on en face preparations of the
entire aorta. Standardization of the lipoprotein assays and atherosclerosis assays will facilitate inter-laboratory
collaboration and data comparisons. In addition, the Core will relieve the individual laboratories from having to
learn and perform the laborious assays for atherosclerosis quantification.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ESKAPE pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species are life- threatening superbugs due to their ability to escape the killing of traditional antibiotics. According to the Centers for Diseas Control and Prevention, these six types of bad bugs cause two thirds of the health care-associated infections, leading to 99,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is stunning that the annual frequency of deaths from Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is comparable to those caused by HIV/AIDS. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new treatments against superbugs. Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are universal host defense molecules that have retained their potency throughout the years. To effectively exploit these interesting compounds, we have been constructing, expanding, and updating the widely used Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD; http://aps.unmc.edu/AP). This comprehensive database facilitates naming, classification, statistical analysis, search, prediction and design of
novel antimicrobials with desired properties. The APD tool has facilitated the research and education in the antimicrobial peptide field and laid a solid basis for this project. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that most critical parameters can be extracted from the APD as a basis for designing and optimizing potent antimicrobial peptides that cause damage on bacterial membranes, leading to bacterial death and augmenting host defense. To test our hypothesis, we have designed the following specific aims: (1) To identify the critical parameters that determine potency of antimicrobial peptides and their mimics based on the APD; (2) To elucidate the critical modulator in antimicrobial peptides that determines mechanism of action and potential bacterial response genes; and (3) To examine the efficacy of database-designed peptides and their mimics against bacterial biofilm infection in vivo and mechanisms of immune modulation. To accomplish these aims, the PI has assembled a strong team that provides complementary expertise needed to understand host-pathogen interactions at the genetic, protein, and structural level as well as peptide-mediated immune responses in vivo using animal models. Because our database-designed compounds represent a novel antimicrobial strategy that effectively attenuated resistant superbugs both in vitro and in vivo, the outcome of this innovative research has great potential in providing potent antimicrobial agents that benefit patients.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While isolation of stem cells has advanced dramatically in the last few decades, understanding of the precise mechanisms that regulate the self-renewal and lineage commitment of a stem cell is still limited. During hematopoiesis, progeny of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) become committed to differentiate into specific cell lineages to ultimately generate terminally differentiated cells. Transcription factors have been recognized for their ability to drive expression of a characteristic set of lineage-specific target
genes, instructing a precursor cell to adopt a certain differentiation program. Dysregulation of transcription factor activity has an important role in leukemia, implicating these genes as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in blood, and other forms of cancer. When we analyzed purified pre-leukemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in a murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model, we found 4-fold upregulation of a novel non-clustered homeobox gene, H2.0-like homeobox (Hlx), suggesting that Hlx may be involved in healthy hematopoiesis and malignant transformation. Our preliminary studies indicate that overexpression of Hlx disrupts healthy myeloid differentiation and confers unlimited serial clonogenicity and a myelomonocytic differentiation block to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of Hlx causes loss of phenotypic HSC and persistence of an expanded, aberrant myeloid progenitor population in vivo. We also find that Hlx regulates a network of genes important for lineage commitment and myeloid differentiation of HSPC. Strikingly, we find that Hlx is overexpressed in the majority of patients with AML, and that Hlx expression is one of the strongest predictors of AML patient survival. We also find that Hlx downregulation inhibits growth of murine and human AML cells in vitro. This project aims to understand how Hlx is regulating these critical functions in HSC and during myeloid differentiation. To characterize the roles of Hlx in lineage commitment of stem and progenitor cells, as well as in myeloid differentiation and acute myeloid leukemia cells, we will utilize genetic murine models, stem cell transplantation assays and targeted reduction of Hlx levels in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism of action of Hlx, we will study downstream pathways we have identified by transcriptional profiling and perform chromatin-immunoprecipitation to establish Hlx as a transcription factor capable of directly regulating its target genes.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)  
  
RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

With  advancing  age,  the  thymus  undergoes  striking  fibrotic  and  fatty  changes that culminate in its transformation into adipose tissue. The lineage of ectopic adipocytes and  the  mechanism  of  development  of  thymic  adipocytes  during  aging  are  not  well  understood.  Using  lineage-tracing,  our  research  team  has  shown  that  FoxN1+  thymic  epithelial  cells  (TECs),  that  are  necessary  for  T  cell  development,  can  transition  and 
give  rise  to  thymic  adipogenic  precursors.  Consistent  with  this  new  paradigm,  our  lates  preliminary  data  provide  further  in  vivo  evidence  that  proadipogenic  cells  in  aging  thymus  can  originate  from  epithelial  and  endothelial  lineages  via  a  secondary mesenchymal precursor. Based on our novel findings, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the transition of TECs and endothelial cells contribute towards the lineage of thymic adipocytes and leads to age-related thymic involution.  The  corollary  is  that  blocking  the  fibrogenesis  and  pro- adipogenic  signaling  in  TEC  and  endothelial  lineage  cells  will  protect  against  aging  of  thymus.  Experiments  in  Aim  1  will  test  the  hypothesis  1  that with  advancing  age  transition  of  FoxN1+  cells  into  adipogenic precursors via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process gives rise to ectopic thymic  adipocytes and compromises the thymic stromal microenvironment. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis 2 that  that  endothelial-lineage  cells  serve  as  adipogenic  progenitors  and  will  reveal  that  blocking  he  ectopic  adipocyte development in thymic perivascular space protect against thymic aging. The Aim 3 will test the hypothesis 3 that age-related fibrogenesis in thymus causes reduction in thymopoiesis and reveal that mechanisms that commit secondary mesenchymal cells into adipocytes participate in thymic dysfunction.   The long-term goal of this research project is to understand the mechanisms that cause thymic adiposity and to develop new approaches to prevent or reverse the process of age-related thymic involution.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is the major cause of skin infection, ranging from cutaneous abcess to celluliltis and folliculitis. It has a well-recognized capacity to exhibit antibiotic resistance, limiting treatment options. Methicillin-resistant S. aurus (MRSA) was traditionally a nosocomial pathogen but community-associated MSRA clones have emerged as a cause of severe necrotizing cutaneous infection, particularly in young, previously healthy children. Better preventive and therapeutic options are important but a major deficiency is a lack of an effective vaccine. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of MRSA skin infection by developing broadly-effective immunotherapeutics and vaccines based on a deep understanding of host-microbial interactions and molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent lipid mediator produced during inflammation that is a well-known neutrophil chemoattractant. We have shown that LTB4 enhances macrophage phagocytosis and killing against different classes of pathogens (including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Leishmania amazonensis). In addition, we discovered that LTB4 is needed for optimal expression of the Toll-like receptor adaptor Myeloid Differentiation Factor -88 (MyD88) in macrophages. We newly hypothesize that LTB4 will improve host defense against MSRA. More specifically, we speculate that LTB4 will enhance innate immune responses, such as macrophage phagocytosis and killing, neutrophil leukocyte recruitment, and LTB4 will amplify cellular responsiveness to MRSA by enhancing MyD88 expression. We propose the following innovative Specific Aim: Investigate whether LTB4 enhances cutaneous MRSA clearance. Our objective is to investigate the extent to which LTB4 can be used as a novel immunotherapeutic agent against MRSA. Our in vivo experiments will test the immunoprotective actions of LTB4 and will reveal the signaling programs elicited by LTB4 that enhance host defense. Due to the known actions of LTB4 that enhance immune defenses in vivo, we predict that this lipid will exhibit potent immunotherapeutic properties in both lung and skin MRSA infection.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Information flow through the cerebellar cortex is highly regulated to ensure tight control over out-going motor commands. One of the key players in regulating the tone of information flow into the cerebellar cortex is the Golgi cell (GoC), an inhibitory interneuron residing the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. This tight control
over motor commands is necessary to prevent movement related pathologies like the many spinocerebellar ataxias. One way information flow is regulated is through the specificity of connections between neurons and information flow through synapses. However, extrasynaptic transmission does take place in many brain regions and can be involved in several pathological states such as Alzheimer's disease. Our lab recently showed that glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, can spill out of the climbing fiber (CF) - Purkinje cell (PC) synapse to activate glutamate receptors on interneurons in the molecular layer of the cerebellum without a synapse present. Many studies suggest that this extrasynaptic transmission provides another layer of flexibility to information encoding in the brain. Similar to findings in the molecular layr of the cerebellum, we have found that CF released glutamate also spills over to Golgi cells. The consequences of glutamate spillover to GoCs are still unknown. To determine the effect of CF glutamate spillover to GoCs and its effects on input processing, we will 1) define the molecular mechanisms of CF glutamate spillover and their effects on GoC output and 2) determine how CF spillover modulates the processing of inputs to the cerebellar cortex. These goals will be accomplished using several diverse techniques including electrophysiology and optogenetics under the expert supervision of the sponsor and collaborators. The aforementioned work will provide insight into the role of GoCs in gating information flow into the cerebellar cortex. Our ability to study extrasynaptic signaling under healthy conditions will allow us to further our understanding of extrasynaptic signaling as it relates to pathology. This work will not only benefi our understanding of healthy cerebellar processing, but also enhance our understanding of disease states in which the cerebellum plays a role. Training plan for the PI consists of participation in journal clubs, formal lab meetings, speaking at seminar opportunities, formal and informal technical and ethical scientific training, regular meetings with the mentor, and presentations at national scientific forums.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

The proposed studies are focused on understanding the basis of urovirulence of E. coli by the comparative genome-wide analysis of strains that will be isolated from a large number of patients with first-time and recurrent cystitis and healthy women. The central hypothesis is that the relatively few clonal groups involved in UPEC human pathogenesis can be defined and characterized as to their key genetic loci and the impact of genetic variations on UPEC virulence. Our preliminary data support that we can investigate sizeable samples of fresh isolates, establish strong clonal associations with recurrent cystitis and determine genome- wide the pathogenicity-adaptive genetic changes. We will determine how mutational changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions/deletions, etc) and horizontal gene transfer contribute to the emergence of UPEC. Our aim is to potentially examine every gene shared by at least a portion of UPEC strains for being under positive selection for pathogenicity-adaptive mutations or horizontal transfer. For this, we will employ a population genomics-based analysis to trace the mutations and gene transfer, followed by assessment of the functional significance of the representative positively selected loci in UPEC.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of host defense, and although they are used clinically to treat a number of diseases, their precise mechanisms of action remain to be completely understood. IFNs induce the transcription of a subset of genes called IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that are responsible for complex biological effects. Only by understanding the function of individual ISGs will the molecular basis of IFN antiviral activity be realized. Expression of one ISG, ISG54/IFIT2, promotes apoptosis, and the broad objectives of this proposal are to determine the protective role of ISG54 in innate immunity and in viral latency. Mice have been generated with a targeted deletion in the ISG54 gene, and these mice have increased susceptibility to latency establishment by murine ?-herpesvirus 68. 
Host defense mechanisms are uniquely challenged by herpesviruses which evade innate and adaptive immune controls to establish chronic, life-long infections. There is a need to elucidate the dynamic interface between virus and host in order to harness the action of host defense mechanisms in the development of novel therapeutics. The ?-herpesviruses, Epstein Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, are associated with morbidity and mortality worldwide resulting from lymphoproliferative disease, lymphoma, carcinoma, and sarcoma, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. Therapeutic intervention of latent infections is medically challenging. Since these viruses are species-specific, methods to study immune control are limited. The closely related murine ?-herpesvirus 68 provides a vital, small animal model system to dissect virus-host interactions that determine the pathogenic outcome in a natural host. The specific aims of the proposal are designed to evaluate the protective role of ISG54 both in an animal model of infection and in tissue culture systems, and to discover the molecular mechanisms of ISG54 that trigger apoptosis. Specific Aim 1: Establish the role of ISG54 at the host-pathogen interface. Murine models of disease have been invaluable to understand the role of the innate immune system in controlling pathogens. The ISG54 knockout mouse will be used to determine the mechanisms by which ISG54 regulates latent infection of the MHV-68 model pathogen. Specific Aim 2: Determine the molecular mechanisms of ISG54/IFIT2 action. Expression of ISG54 promotes mitochondrial apoptosis, and it is known that ISG54 exists within the cell in large molecular complexes with other proteins. Studies are designed to provide mechanistic insight to the impact of ISG54 on pro-apoptotic factors and critical binding partners. An in vivo model of disease and in vitro systems will be used to dissect
the molecular mechanisms of an IFN-induced host defense gene at the viral interface. Achievement of our objectives is expected to provide knowledge necessary to harness the action of ISG54 and fill the need for new therapeutic development.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The flexible regulation of emotional processes is a hallmark of normal adaptive behavior. To wit, the same stimulus or action can elicit a positive emotional response in one situation, but a negative one in another situation. In general, stimuli or actions can acquire affective meaning through experience. Subjects learn that previously neutral stimuli or actions predict rewarding or aversive events. Thus the motivational significance, or value, of stimuli can be changed by virtue of this experience. Here, value can have either positive or negative valence. Emotional responses to these stimuli may be based in large part on the representation of value. This grant explores the mechanisms by which the brain adjusts representations of the value of learned stimuli. Brain structures likely to participae in implementing these processes include the amygdala, long recognized as a critical structure in coordinating emotional responses, and the prefrontal cortex, which contains two brain areas densely interconnected with the amygdala: the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. These prefrontal areas are thought to confer the type of flexible regulation required for rapid emotional adjustments. In this grant, we will study two different ways in which the value of stimuli and/or actions may be adjusted. In Aim 1, we will study the role of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex in a reversal learning procedure, whereby the previously learned associations of two stimuli reverse (or switch). We will characterize the relationship between processing in the amygdala and ACC during this task, building on our prior work studying the amygdala's relationship with OFC. In Aim 2, we will use two different tasks to study how subjects can adjust their representation of the value of a stimulus by knowing how to apply a rule. In one task, no operant actions are required of the experimental subjects, but reinforcement delivery does follow rules. In the second task, subjects must perform the correct operant action according to a rule in order to obtain reinforcement. The second task was designed to elucidate the differential role of the anterior cingulate cortex, as compared to the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, as the anterior cingulate has been proposed to play a prominent role in action valuation, error monitoring, and subsequent adjustments of behavior. This work has direct relevance to understanding the neural circuitry that becomes dysfunctional in many psychiatric disorders, such as mood and anxiety disorders, as well as schizophrenia. In those disorders, dysfunction in amygdala- prefrontal circuitry likely impairs the type of emotional
flexibility required for normal mental health.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): hERG encodes a potassium channel that is of essential importance to normal cardiac electrophysiology and rhythm control. Its biomedical significance is highlighted by its link to both hereditary (locus LQT2) and acquired Long-QT syndromes. Over 600 deleterious mutations (>440 missense) have been reported in hERG. Why the channel is so susceptible to missense mutations is not known. The majority of LQT2 hERG mutations are believed to result in defective assembly and trafficking to the cell surface-presumably due to misfolding of the nascent hERG channel. There is evidence that folding and trafficking of even wild type channels is tenuous. hERG processing is affected by a wide variety of drugs and environmental stresses. Most investigation has logically focused on how amino acid changes affect channel protein processing. Less is known about mRNA-dependent factors in channel processing. Our preliminary studies analyzed the effects of non-coding (or more appropriately termed, extra-coding information) in hERG mRNA that does not alter amino acid sequence. We found that separate and independent regions of hERG mRNA contain information that greatly affects channel translation and trafficking efficiencies-an unusual occurrence. We postulate that a synergy occurs between the inherently fragile biosynthesis of hERG and the LQT2 missense mutations that contribute to the pathogenesis of hereditary LQT2. Investigation of mechanisms underlying mRNA-dependent processing of hERG channels may lead us to reconsider diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to hereditary and acquired arrhythmia syndromes. The aims of this project are: 1) To determine the specific locale and nature of mRNA elements that affect efficiency of hERG channel translation and trafficking. 2) To determine co- and post-translational mechanisms for mRNA-sequence- specific regulation of hERG channel protein translation and trafficking. 3) To investigate how hERG mRNA- sequence-specific elements impact the pathogenesis of LQT2.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad long term goal of this work is to empower women in the developing world to protect themselves against HIV infection through the use of an HIV microbicide intravaginal ring. In Phase I and II of this project we developed the technology platform to deliver a broad range of antiretrovirals in our Pod IVRs. We confirmed the safety and pharmacokinetics of delivery in sheep and the ability of these rings to prevent infection in the macaque model. We also developed manufacturing methods to produce cGMP rings at a volume sufficient for carrying out clinical trials. In this Phase IIB program we propose
to develop the capacity for cost effective manufacture of commercial lots of HIV microbicide intravaginal rings. Pod ring manufacture comprises 3 steps: blank ring manufacture; pod production; and assembly. We have successfully automated the first two steps to have the capacity for commercial lot production. The specific aim of this Phase IIB proposal is to develop and implement an automated assembly and packaging strategy. Our approach will comprise pilot and feasibility studies in the first year and transfer to cGMP in the second year. The successful completion of this aim will allow commercial lot manufacture which will allow cost-effective provision of microbicide rings to the developing world.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 1.2 million Americans suffer a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) each year. The persistent physical, emotional and cognitive symptoms after mTBI significantly affect the quality of life of patients and their family members, with tremendous
healthcare cost. However, the field still lacks diagnostic and prognostic tools for mTBI due to patients' negative findings in clinical imaging. Despite the progress in the investigation of neuronal and axonal injury, the neurovascular substrates of mTBI are still poorly understood. Evidence from molecular imaging suggests that mTBI causes regional disturbances in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism that account for the patients' neurocognitive and clinical symptoms. To date, the field lacks non- invasive means to assess regional brain tissue metabolism throughout the brain.  Brain injury leads to uncoupling between brain metabolic demand and actual blood supply, so assessing CBF alone does not provide insight into brain tissue metabolism. To paint a more complete picture, one needs to measure both arterial blood supply and the oxygen saturation of draining veins to determine cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), a key measure of brain tissue viability. For arterial blood supply measurement, we have developed methods for perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) analysis to accurately quantify absolute CBF. For venous blood oxygen saturation, we have developed a novel technique, known as susceptibility weighted imaging and mapping (SWIM), to measure the susceptibility of veins. Combining susceptibility with hematocrit, we can calculate the venous blood oxygenation.  Our objective is to identify the neurovascular substrates in mTBI that account for patients' functional and neurocognitive symptoms. We will first calibrate the SWIM quantification of blood oxygenation in an arm vein by a point-of-care blood-gas oximeter and correct its partial volume problem in small veins of the brain (specific aim 1). Then, we will translate the brain imaging technique into mTBI patients to determine the regional CMRO2 (specific aim 2). Finally, we will determine the prognostic value of regional CMRO2 for mTBI patients' 6-month outcome (specific aim 3). Using both SWIM and PWI, we propose to assess brain tissue metabolism and its prognostic value in a cohort of 30 mTBI patients, from acute to chronic stages, in comparison with 30 demographically-matched controls. We hypothesize that CMRO2 will be abnormal in mTBI patients and that the magnitude of the abnormality will account for mTBI patients' neuropsychological and functional deficits. This will be the first time use of SWIM to measure oxygen saturation in mTBI patients. The deliverable of this project will be a set of non-invasive techniques for assessing regional brain tissue metabolism after mTBI, which will help physicians identify the brain tissue at risk for secondary complications as a potential treatment target to prevent long term deficits.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K01 Career Development Award application proposes a multidisciplinary 4-year training program to provide the candidate, Dr. Qibin Qi, with the experience and resources necessary to launch a successful career as an independent investigator. The training plan, developed closely with primary mentor Dr. Kaplan Robert, co-mentor Dr. Kathryn Anastos, and an Advisory Committee, will broaden Dr. Qi's research experience and expertise, including metabolomics, biostatistics and HIV infection and cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology. The proposed research project, building upon two well-characterized HIV cohorts (the Women's Interagency HIV Study [WIHS] and the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study [MACS]), offers the candidate an outstanding opportunity to become proficient in the novel area of metabolomics research as well as in HIV infection and CVD epidemiology. Taking advantage of archived blood samples, extensive data on HIV-infection related factors, longitudinal measurements of carotid artery plaque, and genomic data in the WIHS and MACS, this project proposes to examine plasma levels of metabolites among 495 women and men, aged = 45 years old, without carotid artery plaque at baseline (338 HIV+ and 157 HIV- subjects; 103 subjects had incident carotid plaque over 7-year follow-up measured by B mode ultrasound). Associations of HIV infection and related factors with prior informed cardiometabolic-associated metabolites (e.g., branched-chain amino acids), and associations between these metabolites and progression of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (incident carotid artery plaque) will be examined. In exploratory analyses, advance analytical approached (e.g., network analysis) will be applied to identify novel metabolomic signatures related to HIV infection and subclinical atherosclerosis progression, and to generate a network illustrating interrelationships between genes, metabolites, HIV infection and CVD. In addition, potential HIV-specific metabolomic findings will be examined through collaborations with HIV-uninfected population studies. Findings from this study will provide preliminary data for a larger study proposal to measure metabolomics profiling more comprehensively and longitudinally. These studies will advance our understanding of pathogenesis of HIV infection and CVD and provide useful information for effective strategies in the prevention and management of CVD in HIV-infected patients.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad and long-term goal of this project is to understand the patterning of coronary arteries and their underlying mechanisms. The coronary circulation starts when the passive diffusion of oxygen and nutrients is no longer sufficient for the heart growth and function. The coronary arteries must connect to the aorta through the coronary ostia, the openings at the aortic sinus, to receive the oxygenated blood and nutrients from systemic circulation. We have generated new genetic mouse models to study the developmental and molecular mechanisms of the coronary-aorta connection and coronary patterning. Preliminary results have shown that the myocardial vascular endothelial growth factor-a (Vegfa) is necessary for the connection to form. We have also found that the main receptor for Vegfa, Vegfr2, as well as transcription factor Nfatc1 are co- expressed in the aortic sinus endothelium. Additionally, the aortic sinus is surrounding by hypoxic cardiomyocytes that produce a high level of Vegfa. Building upon these findings, this project is to study in mice when and where the myocardial Vegfa is required for the coronary-aorta connection and whether its function is hypoxia-dependent. We will also address whether Vegfr2 and Nfatc1 function together to regulate the connection process. Specifically, we will genetically disrupt Vegfa, Vegfr2, or Nfatc1 in a spatiotemporal manner during late coronary artery development. Ablation of the hypoxic cardiomyocytes or their expression of Vegfa will establish the role of hypoxia in coronary artery patterning and ostium formation. Deletion of Vegfr2 and Nfatc1 in the endocardium of the aortic sinus will ascertain their roles and potential interactions in these processes. Morphologic, cellular, and molecular analysis of the developing coronary arteries and ostia in these mouse mutants will identify previously unknown developmental mechanisms and molecular interactions involved in late coronary artery development. The information will help understand the etiology of congenital coronary anomalies.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complement is a part of innate immunity and plays a key role in host defense. However, if not properly regulated, activated complement can cause inflammatory injury. Recent works have identified complement as a major pathogenic pathway in many human immunological and inflammatory diseases. Among them, dense deposit disease (DDD) is a rare kidney disease caused by dysregulation of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement activation. DDD is characterized by the presence of electron- dense deposits within the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney. Known also as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN type II), DDD belongs to the recently introduced pathological entity called C3 glomerulopathy whose definition is glomerular pathology characterized by C3 accumulation with no or limited immunoglobulin deposition. Approximately 10% of DDD patients also develop vision problems with dense deposits underneath retinal pigment epithelial cells that resemble drusen deposits in the eyes of age-related macular degeneration patients. Prognosis of DDD is poor since current treatments are largely nonspecific and about 50% patients eventually progress to end stage renal failure. Mechanistic and therapeutic studies of human DDD have been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models. We have recently generated a robust mouse model of DDD displaying both kidney and retinal pathologies. The objective of this application is to use this novel mouse model to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of complement-mediated kidney and retinal injury in DDD and to test the activity of various anti-complement agents in preventing or reversing the kidney and eye pathologies. Our long term goal is to better understand how dysregulated AP complement leads to DDD and other complement-mediated inflammatory disorders and to provide proof of principle for developing novel anti-complement therapies for such human diseases.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

We have previously proposed, and provide proof for, an approach to help identify blood biomarkers for mood state. Such biomarkers can serve as a basis for objective clinical laboratory tests. We are interested in carrying out similar studies to identify blood biomarkers for psychosis and to address the important scientific and clinical issue of specificity vs. overlap between the biomarkers for these disorders.  There are to date no clinical laboratory blood tests for psychosis Given the complex nature of psychotic disorders, the current reliance on patient self-report of symptoms and the clinician's impression on interview of patient is a rate limiting step in deliverig the best possible care with existing treatment modalities, as well as in developing new and improved treatment approaches, including new medications.  We propose to identify biomarkers using Convergent Functional Genomics (CFG), an approach developed by us over the last decade, which is based on comprehensive integration of gene expression and genetic data, from human and animal model studies. We have provided proof of principle for this approach helping to identify blood biomarkers for mood disorders (Le- Niculescu et al. 2009)1 and more recently for psychosis (Kurian et al. 2011)2. In that latter work, we have identified a series of high probability blood candidate biomarker genes for psychosis that deserve future scrutiny. A predictive score developed based on a panel of seven top candidate biomarkers for hallucinations (a key symptom for psychosis), shows good sensitivity and moderate specificity, in independent patient cohorts. Our preliminary studies suggest that blood biomarkers may offer an unexpectedly informative window into brain functioning and psychosis state.  This exciting preliminary work needs to be carefully extended and replicated in a larger independent cohort, as well as compared to normal controls to derive additional normative data, which is what we propose to do in this project. Moreover, there was overlap between our lists of candidate genes and biomarkers for mood disorders and for psychosis, suggesting that we need to better understand the overlap between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and, as a field, explore and refine our integration of nosology with biology. Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care:  The development of clinical laboratory blood tests for psychosis will lead to more targeted treatments for veterans affected by psychiatric disorders involving psychotic symptoms, such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, as well as severe forms of bipolar disorder, depression and PTSD, with improved efficacy and decreased side-effects. This will have an impact on patient health, well-being, safety, quality of life, and independent functioning, as well
as decrease hospitalizations and overall health-care costs. Moreover, biomarker profiling may help with assessing response to treatment, risk of relapse, and early intervention efforts to prevent the full-blown development of illness in susceptible individuals.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections are life threatening and constitute a large health-care burden. Modulation of host immune responses is one paradigm used by pathogens to initiate and prolong infections. Preliminary data demonstrate that P. aeruginosa can degrade the potent immune signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and its precursor sphingosine. S1P degradation would allow P. aeruginosa to alter the host immune response, which could have profound effects on progression of infection and the pathogenesis of disease. Described in this proposal is a previously uncharacterized transcription factor that regulates P. aeruginosa gene expression in response to S1P and sphingosine and is required for their degradation. Deletion of this transcription factor reduces P. aeruginosa virulence in vivo, highlighting the importance of this pathway during infection. Characterization of the detection and metabolism of sphingosine by P. aeruginosa will be a concrete contribution to understanding of sphingosine-related compounds in bacterial biology and pathogenesis. The long term goal is to understand the role of P. aeruginosa S1P and sphingosine metabolism during the course of lung infection. In pursuit of this long-term goal, the overall objectives of this application are to characterize the recognition
and degradation system used by P. aeruginosa to respond to S1P and determine the impact of S1P degradation on P. aeruginosa virulence in the lung. The central hypothesis is that P. aeruginosa detection of S1P induces genes necessary for S1P degradation, which promotes virulence. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Characterize S1P and sphingosine-dependent transcription in P. aeruginosa~ (2) Identify the components of the S1P degradation pathway~ and (3) Test the impact of S1P degradation on P. aeruginosa infection. The goals of Aim 1 are to determine the ligand and promoter-binding specificities of the sphingosine-responsive transcription factor by promoter mapping, DNA binding, and reporter assays, and determine its contribution to the sphingosine regulon using microarray analysis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify the P. aeruginosa S1P phosphatase and the enzymes that degrade sphingosine using genetic screens, metabolite tracking, and in vitro enzymatic assays. Finally, the goal of Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis that the reduced virulence of the transcription factor mutant is due to lack of S1P degradation, versus regulation of genes unrelated to degradation, using a mouse model of lung infection established in the applicant's lab. This proposal is innovative because it will advance understanding of a previously uncharacterized sphingosine detection and metabolic pathway, which may be used by P. aeruginosa to detect the host and interfere with a potent host signaling pathway. The proposed research is significant because it will expand understanding of the metabolic links between bacterial pathogens and the host, perhaps leading to novel antimicrobial or anti-virulence therapies.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA processing alterations are increasingly recognized to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases including two devastating neurodegenerative conditions, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontal temporal dementia (FTD). The seminal discovery in 2011 of a hexanucleotide expansion in the C9orf72 gene as the most common cause of familial ALS and FTD significantly changed our perspective of these neurodegenerative diseases. The pathogenic mechanisms of this expansion are not yet understood. However recent lines of evidence, including from my own work, strongly support a gain of toxic property by accumulation of repeat-containing RNAs that are bidirectionally transcribed from the C9orf72 locus. Independent reports of RNA changes in fibroblasts, neurons derived from iPS cells and motor cortex from C9orf72 patients have offered evidence that RNA processing misregulation accompanies C9orf72 disease. However, it is still unresolved whether these RNA alterations are induced by the functional disruption of one or more RNA binding proteins sequestered into RNA foci or induced by another cytotoxic mechanism such as the striking accumulation of dipeptide repeat proteins translated from expanded RNAs that was recently reported in C9orf72 patients. In this project, I propose to define a set of alterations in mRNA processing that delineate a disease-dependent signature and that will serve as functional readouts to distinguish among current hypotheses for disease mechanism underlying C9orf72 ALS/FTD. By using genomic approaches optimized for precise identification of splicing and expression changes and human neurons specifically engineered to individually explore toxic mechanisms currently proposed, my group will determine which factor(s) drive the emergence of RNA processing alterations in C9orf72 disease. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that RNA alterations are induced either by sense or antisense repeat- containing RNAs. We will also use a functional screen to determine whether C9orf72-related RNA alterations are driven by reduced activity of one or more RNA binding proteins, including the proteins recently found to interact with the C9orf72 expanded repeats. Finally, my team will use the C9orf72 molecular signature to screen therapeutic compounds. Indeed, we and others have already established that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting C9orf72 transcripts efficiently reduce pathological RNA foci in patient cells. I now propose to determine whether degradation of expanded RNAs transcribed from either the sense or antisense directions (or both), is necessary to restore RNA processing alterations linked to C9orf72 disease, an approach that may provide crucial information for the design of a clinical trial using ASOs in C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients. Disease-related RNA signatures will also serve as readouts to screen new therapeutic compounds in neurons directly derived from patient fibroblasts. Indeed, instead of using a single target RNA to determine drug efficacy, we will use quantitative analysis of a large panel of genes perturbed by C9orf72 expansions to identify small molecules that can intervene with disease-linked pathways to restore levels of the most affected RNAs.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application for grant AI-41236-A1. Our major goal is to obtain definitive proof that the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Treg) control self-tolerance. We have recently succeeded in establishing an excellent autoimmune disease model induced by Treg depletion alone. Diphtherial toxin treatment of B6AF1-DEREG mice (express DTR-foxp3 transgene in artificial chromosome) leads to transient Treg loss for 7 days. Six weeks later, the mice develop multi-organ autoimmune disease that targets the testis, ovary, stomach and lacrimal gland. The mice produce autoAb against the testis germ cell and Leydig cell Ag, ovarian theca cell Ag and the ZP3 (335) epitope, and gastric ATPase. They are healthy-looking, gain weight and survive normally. Our focus is on the gonadal diseases because they resemble the disease in >60% of autoimmune polyendocrine sydnrome type I (APS1) patients. APS1 is rare but of immense significance. The cause is a mutation of the autoimmune Responder (AIRE) gene, a known participant in central tolerance. We are acknowledged as leaders in gonadal autoimmunity research and the best candidate for this investigation. We discovered that Treg depletion leads to a Teff and Treg imbalance, governed by the intrinsic Treg strength. The net response determines disease outcome. B6AF1-DEREG mice show dominant Teff cell response and develop autoimmune disease. B6-DEREG mcie show a dominant Treg response and do not have autoimmunity. We also discovered that the Teff cells of B6AF1-DEREG mice with AO resist Treg suppression, and they express low levels Cbl-b. Cbl-b is an E3 ligase the controls the TCR response threshold. In Aim 1, we will verify the T cell imbalance hypothesis and study the causal relation of Treg resistance to Cbl-b expression. Unexpectedly, the germ cell-specific response is Th2-dominant and autoAb is IgG1-dominant. AO is not associated with testis inflammation, but is associated with massive IgG1+ immune complex (IC) that targets germ cell Ag. Importantly, the cause of testis failure and infertility are Sertoli cell injury and blood-testis barrier (BTB) disruption. The Sertoli cells normally control BTB and sperm production. In Aim 2, we will investigate eosinophil in promoting the IgG1 autoAb response, and define an Fc receptor-dependent mechanism for the Sertoli cell injury as a cause of AO. Also unexpected is the finding that B6-DEREG mice, after Treg depletion, spontaneously lose testis immune privilege and stop making sperm. Amazingly, this novel process is reversible with full recovery, and thus it can be controlled by Treg. The B6AF1-DEREG mice also develop a similar early innate cell injury in the testis. In Aim 3, we will determine whether this unique, non-autoimmune innate cell- mediate injury will predispose the testis to autoAb-mediated AO. In summary, our exciting and highly novel project will provide definitive proof for Treg as a non-redundant tolerance mechanism. Our study will define many Treg functions relevant to many common human diseases such as: pemphigus vulgaris, IC disease (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome, APS1, gastritis, and male and female idiopathic infertility due to gonadal failure.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies indicates that adult autologous stem cell based therapies show modest improvement of cardiac function. Emerging evidence from preclinical studies also suggests that hostile micro-environment in the infarcted myocardium, including inflammation and oxidative damage, have adverse effects on transplanted stem cell survival and function thereby posing a significant barrier to the adult stem cell-based therapies for repair of injured myocardium. Therefore, novel approaches to enhance full functional benefits of stem cell based therapies are critically needed. Pluripotent Stem cells including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have provided an alternative for the resurrection of damaged myocardium yet their use remains technically challenging and risky and cellular derivatives of pluripotent cells may still face the similar challenges of low engraftment and survival as is noted with adult stem cells. Therefore use of cell-free components derived from stem cells including iPS and ES cells, need to be explored for their reparative potential. Exosomes derived from such cells may provide one such cell-free source. Exosomes, known regulators of intercellular communication, carry the cell specific mRNA/miRNA signature and participate in cell-cell communication by transferring their materials to the target cells. Our preliminary data indicates that, ESC derived exosomes represent a novel cell free system capable of supporting myocardial regeneration, in part, by inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation and by enhancing cardiac progenitor cell augmentation, proliferation and differentiation. Therefore we hypothesize that ES/iPS-derived exosomes may represent a novel strategy to augment endogenous repair processes in the infarcted myocardium. Our goal is to establish that pluripotent stem cell-derived exosomes as a novel cell free therapeutic regimen for myocardial repair in response to chronic pathological insult. The significance of this study is to develop a novel understanding of the role played by mES cell derived exosomes in supporting cardiomyocyte and cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) based reparative processes in the heart. We will also extend these studies to determine the contribution of pluripotent cell specific miRNAs in regulating CPC reparative response to pathologic injury. Establishing the therapeutic value of these exosomes would help develop a novel cell free system to enhance myocardial repair and would provide a new direction for the restoration and/or augmentation of endogenous myocardial repair process.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION:  We propose a novel approach to treat insufficient venous flow. It relies on the use of minipumps made of engineered cardiac muscle. If successful, this approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of chronic venous disease and other causes of limited flow, including direct injury and paralysis of lower limb muscles. Specifically, our long term goal
is use a patient's stem cells to create a rhythmically beating sheath of cardiac muscle cells that surrounds medium-sized veins. These 'Cardiomyocyte-based Venous Assist Devices or CMVAD will aid flow without requiring recreation of the heart's structural complexity. The main goal of this application is to obtain proof-of-the concept data for this novel approach using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes. Experiments will be structured along two specific aims. The first specific aim is to test the ability of CMVAD o create pressure within close-ended excised segments of canine, porcine or human saphenous veins and to examine how much the electric and mechanical stimulation of CMVAD improves its physical strength and force of contraction. The second specific aim is to a) compare different CMVAD designs for their ability to continuously propel fluid thru an excised vein segment with functional unidirectional valve and b) test feasibility of peristaltic fluid propulsion by electriclly stimulating a downstream end of an elongated CMVAD sleeve placed around vein segment without functional valve. To the best of our knowledge the proposed methodology would be one of the first examples of using tissue engineering protocols not just to repair damaged organs but to design entirely new ones - either outside the organ's original anatomical location or using the functionality of specialized cells from different tissues.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory cues can be attractive or repulsive depending on the context in which they are present. To make contextually appropriate decisions, the brain must integrate sensory information in the environment with its own internal needs. Biogenic amines are small molecules that the brain releases that cause changes in neural circuit function and drive contextually appropriate behavior. Dopamine release encodes motivation and salience and regulates reward-driven behaviors. In humans, regulation of dopamine signaling is critical: too much dopamine signaling is implicated in schizophrenia, whereas decreased dopamine signaling is implicated in Parkinson's Disease. How dopamine dynamically modulates neural circuits to effect state-dependent changes on behavior is poorly understood. The experiments in this proposal will investigate how dopamine acts at the gene, cell, and circuit levels to alter CO2 response behavior as a function of starvation in C. elegans. 
We have found that, when fed, C. elegans adults avoid CO2, an evolutionarily advantageous strategy that may allow them to evade CO2-emitting predators. Within 3 hours of starvation, worms switch from avoiding CO2 to being attracted to it. We have implicated a role for dopamine in this switch. Worms with no dopamine are constitutively attracted to CO2 and worms with increased dopamine have attenuated attraction to CO2 even when starved. We have identified a dopamine receptor that is involved in mediating the switch from CO2 avoidance to attraction. We will investigate how dopaminergic signaling regulates CO2-evoked behavior using pharmacogenetics, quantitative worm tracking, and time-lapse imaging of dopaminergic neuron activity (Aim 1). We will then dissect how dopamine functionally alters the CO2 microcircuit by imaging activity of CO2 circuit neurons in wild-type worms and mutants with altered dopaminergic signaling (Aim 2). Finally, we will take a systems-based approach to image and perturb neural circuit function in intact, freely moving animals to determine how dopamine-mediated changes in neuronal activity directly translate to observable changes in behavior (Aim 3).  These experiments will provide fundamental insights into how dopamine dynamically modulates neuronal circuits and may elucidate how dysregulation of dopaminergic signaling leads to sensory deficits seen in neuropsychiatric disease.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity give rise to sensory perception is a fundamental aim of neurobiology. Despite intensive investigation, substantial disagreements remain over the nature of neural codes, and basic operating principles of the cortex remain obscure. Despite recent advances in optogenetics, new experimental approaches are required to address the problem. The goal of this proposal is to develop a new experimental paradigm capable of both monitoring and enforcing spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity during behavior and employ it to dissect how cortical circuits encode information during a sensory discrimination task. By combining multiphoton microscopy and new advances in optogenetics, we will complete development of a system capable of simultaneously imaging and stimulating unique sequences of neurons in three dimensions during active sensation in an awake mouse with millisecond temporal resolution. By manipulating identified neurons during sensation, we will mechanistically probe how the activity of highly discriminating neurons influences activity in the cortical network
and biases sensory perception.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic etiology and the molecular mechanisms of combined hyperlipidemia (CHL), the most common lipid disorder of the general population is not understood. Accordingly, no single therapeutic agent is available that completely normalizes both plasma LDL and TG, and or prevent cardiovascular disease. We have identified rare loss of function mutations in Wnt coreceptor LRP6 that underlie early atherosclerosis, and metabolic phenotypes including CHL. Since our initial discovery altered plasma levels and or functions of Wnt proteins and LRP6 antagonists have been associated with risk of hyperlipidemia and early onset CAD in the general population. In addition, common variants in Wnt transcription factor TCF7L2 have been associated with familial CHL. These findings have implicated Wnt signaling in hyperlipidemia and early onset atherosclerosis. To investigate disease mechanisms, mice with the human LRP6R611C (LRP6mut/mut) point mutation were generated. LRP6mut/mut mice exhibit significantly elevated plasma triglycerides (TG) and LDL cholesterols on high cholesterol diet, which dramatically increases after they are crossbred onto LDLR/ mice. Further studies in these mice revealed enhanced expression of liver IGF1/IGF1R associated with augmented activities of AKT/mTOR pathways, leading to increased SREBP1 and 2 activation, lipid synthesis and ApoB secretion. Strikingly, these changes normalized and hyperlipidemia was rescued by systemic Wn3a administration. We have devised several mouse models and propose to study the role of canonical Wnt/?tenin/ TCF7L2, and their potential downstream pathways IGF1 and mTORC2 in regulation of lipid synthesis and ApoB secretion. These studies hold great promise for identifying novel pathways and potential targets for development of therapeutics against combined hyperlipidemia.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

1 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been referred to as the signature wound of Operation Enduring Freedom and 2 Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) (Koehler et al., 2011). The consequences of TBI can be complex and 3 veterans with TBI exhibit a wide range of cognitive impairments including deficits of executive function and  4 memory (Sayer et al., 2008). TBI is also often accompanied by hearing loss and/or tinnitus in the majority of 5 TBI patients (Fausti, Wilmington, Gallun, Myers, & Henry, 2009) due to both cochlear damage and damage to 6 the central auditory system. Because hearing disorders disrupt both speech comprehension (Wilson et al., 7 2007) and working memory (Surprenant, 2007) it is essential to understand how hearing and memory interact 8 in patients with TBI. However, the connection between TBI-related hearing loss and TBI-related deficits in  9 memory has received relatively little study, despite research showing how other types of hearing loss, 10 particularly in older adults, can impact memory (McCoy et al., 2005; Miller & Wingfield, 2010). 11 To better understand the ultimate cause of the cognitive impairments associated with TBI, this project 12 will investigate auditory perception and cognition in veterans with TBI. We will investigate speech perception in 13 patient with TBI and evaluate the degree to which hearing deficits contribute to deficits in speech perception 14 and auditory working memory. We will also examine the relationship between the abnormalities in brain 15 structure and functional brain activation of TBI patients and their performance on tests of hearing, speech 16 perception and memory. The results will clarify the brain regions that play central roles in auditory cognition 17 and elucidate the peripheral and central factors that contribute to impaired cognition in TBI patients. 18 These aims serve to enhance the understanding of cognitive deficits that follow TBI and facilitate the 19 development of targeted rehabilitation. Although audiologic screening of TBI patients is not routine, previous 20 studies have found hearing abnormalities in more than 50% of patients with blast-related TBI (Lew et al., 21 2009). It is particularly useful to examine the incidence of hearing and phonological processing deficits in TBI 22 populations because audiological rehabilitation with hearing aids and perceptual training (Woods & Yund, 23 2007) can significantly improve speech comprehension. Identifying those patients who are likely to benefit from 24 hearing-based versus memory-based rehabilitation is thus a central goal of the current proposal. The analysis 25 of brain structural abnormalities with innovative structural MRI techniques will also add to the understanding of 26 the structural basis of TBI-related cognitive deficits. 27 This grant would serve as the beginning of Dr. Marc Ettlinger's independent research career at the VA. 28 This first project will provide the basis for future RR&D grants assessing the degree to which hearing training 29 and working memory training can contribute to TBI rehabilitation. The medium-term goal is to submit a Merit 30 Review award grant to RR&D in the final year of this proposed project addressing this issue. Dr. Ettlinger is an 31 ideal
candidate to pursue this research because of his record publishing on neuroimaging (Ettlinger, et al., 32 submitted; Wong, et al., 2010), phonetics and phonology (Ettlinger & Johnson, 2009; Ettlinger et al., 2011) and 33 language and memory (Ettlinger et al., 2010; Ettlinger et al., in press). 34 The research will be conducted at VANCHCS, one of the leading centers in the VA for studying brain- 35 behavior relationships. The Neurology Research group at Martinez VA has unique patient resources and a 36 strong track record in cognitive neuropsychology. The Brain Imaging Center at the Martinez VA campus has 37 state of the art facilities for acquiring DT images and conventional structural scans.

The overall goal of this project is to determine whether arthroscopic meniscectomy in degenerative meniscal tears is beneficial from a clinical and scientific viewpoint relative to a non-meniscectomy surgical control. Arthroscopic meniscectomy is among the most commonly performed orthopedic surgical procedures in the VA system and nationally. 80% of patients in our practice having knee arthroscopy for meniscus tears have been in the 45-70 years age group and 53% of these patients had degenerative meniscal tears without a large unstable flap. These data are comparable of arthroscopic meniscectomy data drawn in other settings. However, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the short term benefits and the long term consequences of arthroscopic meniscectomy in patients with degenerative meniscus tears. Degenerative meniscus tears are associated with osteoarthritis, and it is known that within two years of surgery, arthroscopic debridement for osteoarthritis is no better than placebo in relieving pain and restoring function. Longer term, meniscectomy has been shown to be associated with elevated risk of osteoarthritis development, raising the concern that meniscectomy can actually be harmful. It has also been shown by our group that patients with clinically successful arthroscopic posterior medial meniscectomy have significant change in the rotational motion of the knee during walking. Rotational changes at the knee follow soft tissue damage and have been implicated in the causes for cartilage degeneration.  Thus there are critical unanswered questions regarding the clinical benefit as well as the scientific basis for arthroscopic meniscectomy for degenerative meniscal tear. To address these questions this project will conduct a prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled study of arthroscopic meniscectomy in patients between the ages of 45 and 70 with stable degenerative meniscus tears. In this study, the control group will be a group of patients having arthroscopic lavage of the joint, but no debridement of a stable degenerative meniscus tear. The Aims will address clinical (self-reported) and scientific outcomes (functional) of arthroscopic meniscectomy in the time frame lasting up to two years after surgery. Aim 1: Test the clinical benefit of arthroscopic meniscectomy in the setting of a stable degenerative meniscus tear.  Hypothesis 1a: There will be significant differences in WOMAC scores between the Meniscectomy and the Non-Meniscectomy/Lavage Groups at 12 months after surgery.  Hypothesis 1b: The WOMAC scores of the Non-Meniscectomy/Lavage group will not be inferior to the WOMAC scores of the Meniscectomy group at 12 months after surgery Aim 2: Test the functional effect of arthroscopic meniscectomy in the setting of a degenerative meniscus tear.  Hypothesis 2: Subjects randomized to arthroscopy and meniscectomy will have greater changes in tibio- femoral rotation, knee adduction moment, and knee flexion moment at 12 months following surgery when compared to subjects randomized to arthroscopy and lavage. We will also pursue other exploratory aims that are oriented towards understanding and characterizing the progression of incipient osteoarthritis from a clinical, biological, and radiographic standpoint. This prospective coordinated, multi-disciplinary approach will provide an important clinical and scientific assessment of arthroscopic meniscectomy that will improve treatment planning for degenerative meniscal tears. It will also provide new insight into incipient arthritis, yielding important information that will impact future patient care.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
A primary impairment associated with post-stroke hemiparesis is the failure to make rapid graded adjustment of muscle force (i.e. muscle power) within the context of purposeful complex synergies (e.g., coordination during walking). Not surprisingly, the impact of stroke on walking is
significant, with less than 50% of survivors progressing to independent community ambulation. Even among those who achieve independent ambulation, significant residual deficits persist in balance and gait speed, with ~75% of persons post-stroke reporting limitations in mobility related to walking. Muscle weakness is the most prominent motor consequence among the nearly 6 million survivors of stroke living in the United States and the strongest predictor of functional disability in this large clinical cohort. To date, the physiological mechanisms that contribute to muscle dysfunction in hemiparetic subjects are largely unstudied. Moreover, evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions aimed at attenuating impaired muscle function and the ensuing functional consequences in the post-stroke population is equivocal and viable therapeutic options to remediate hemiparetic muscle weakness remain among the most pressing challenges for biomedical research. We propose that impaired muscle power (the product of muscle strength and velocity) generation is causal of functional (walking) disability post-stroke. In addition, coordination deficits are also critical determinants of functional performance. We have developed a comprehensive theoretical framework that defines and measures the factors underlying disordered muscle function and coordination and will apply this framework to Post-stroke Optimization of Walking using Explosive Resistance (POWER) training. Our goals over the four year funding period are to 1) quantify neural and muscular adaptations that contribute to impaired muscle power generation post-stroke; 2) assess effects of POWER training on neural and muscular adaptations in paretic and non-paretic muscle; and 3) determine the relationship between changes in neural and muscular adaptations following POWER training and locomotor improvements. Innovative aspects of the proposed work include the novel training intervention; the advanced magnetic resonance assessments; as well as the unique measure of the coordination that we propose. It is our belief that: a) neural and muscular adaptations following stroke are associated with impaired muscle power generation as well as locomotor ability, b) POWER training attenuates functional deficits by addressing the underlying neural and muscular elements and c) functional improvements following training are predicated on improving the most prominent neural and muscular contributors to muscle power generation. If correct, the data generated will provide an entirely new level of evidence regarding the effectiveness of this novel intervention strategy on improving functional performance as well as the importance of peripheral muscle properties as predictors of locomotor ability post-stroke.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sinoatrial node (SAN), located in the right atrium, serves as the natural cardiac pacemaker and is responsible for initiating each normal heartbeat. SAN dysfunction, characterized by slow and/or irregular pacemaker activity, is common in cardiovascular disease and in the aging population and is a major indicator for cardiac pacemaker implantation. While defects in activity of multiple ion channels have been linked to abnormal SAN cell membrane excitability and SAN dysfunction, little is known about molecular pathways responsible for ion channel membrane targeting.  Recent studies from our group have identified a novel role for the actin-associated polypeptide BetaIV spectrin in organizing local signaling domains for membrane ion channels in ventricular myocytes. However, the pathways responsible for organization of analogous domains in SAN cells remain largely unstudied. There is a need to elucidate the mechanisms by which ion channel membrane domains are coordinated to regulate cardiac pacemaking.  The objective of this proposal is to define the role of the actin-associated polypeptide Beta-IV spectrin in ion channel targeting and regulation of membrane excitability in SAN cells, and to develop quantitative tools for analysis of SAN cell behavior and susceptibility to dysfunction. My central hypothesis is that Beta-IV spectrin determines normal membrane localization of the mechanosensitive background K+ channel TREK-1 to control SAN cell membrane excitability. Furthermore, I hypothesize that disruption of the Beta-IV spectrin/TREK-1 complex at the sinoatrial node membrane promotes abnormal cell membrane excitability and sinus node dysfunction.  My hypotheses will be tested using an innovative combination of experimental and mathematical modeling techniques. I believe that the findings from these studies will identify a pathway for targeting TREK-1 to the sinoatrial node
membrane, will develop new analytical/mathematical tools to understand SAN function, and will generate new directions for future research of cell excitability and cardiac pacemaking in normal and diseased hearts.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recognition of the persistent and increasing challenges in attracting and retaining physician investigators (PIs) in academic medical schools and other research venues, there is widespread agreement within the biomedical research community that there needs to be renewed assessment of the factors that threaten this critically important career pathway as well as the development of ways to revitalize the PI workforce. Association of Professors of Medicine (APM) and Association of Specialty Professors (ASP) held a series of conferences resulting in published and disseminated recommendations to expand the pool of funds to retain and foster the careers of young scientists; improve the approach to mentorship of young investigators; promoting the advancement of women scientists; and identify and foster the career development of future scientists (medical and undergraduate university students). In response to growing concerns about existing NIH support for physician scientists, Director Francis Collins charged a Physician Scientist Workforce Working Group to assess the current mechanisms of career support and make recommendations for improvement. In June, 2014, the Working Group issued their report with a series of recommendations which urged the NIH to sustain strong training of MD PhDs; shift the balance in postdoctoral training for physicians; continue to address the gap in award rates between new and established investigators; and adopt rigorous tools to assess the strength of the biomedical workforce including PIs. With the goal of stimulating a vigorous, ongoing national dialog on the factors which threaten the physician investigator workforce, the Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine (AAIM) Board of Directors endorsed the development of Third Consensus Conference on the PI Workforce, entitled Re-examining the Physician Investigator Workforce: New and Evolving Areas of Research and Pathways to Success in Academic Institutions. This R13 application looks to leverage AAIM support to expand the discussion and dialog surrounding the physician investigator workforce. The aims of this conference are to assess the current environment in which academic medical centers develop the careers of PIs, and to seek innovative solutions (beyond federal funding) to overcome existing challenges so as to maintain and expand a vigorous workforce.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research is to identify novel mechanisms that regulate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). ILC2 are a recently discovered population of lineage-negative lymphocytes that produce Th2 cytokines in response to epithelial cytokines IL-33 and TSLP. ILC2 contribute to an asthma phenotype in animal models and are present in human lungs. Specifically, we hypothesize that the RNA-binding protein RBM3 controls human and mouse ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and innate type 2 lung responses through Th2 cytokine mRNA stabilization. We will administer allergen, IL-33, and TSLP challenges to the airways of WT and RBM3 knockout mice and assess lung ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and proliferation, as well as levels of BAL eosinophils, epithelial mucus production, peribronchial infiltration and airway hyperresponsiveness. We will also perform ILC2 adoptive transfer studies and generate RBM3 deficient IL-13 reporter mice to define the role of RBM3 in ILC2 during allergen, IL-33, and TSLP-induced airway inflammation. We will perform in vitro studies with purified ILC2 from WT and RBM3 knockout mice as well as human RMB3 siRNA knockdown ILC2 stimulated with IL-33 and TSLP and assess levels of ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and proliferation. Further, we will perform mRNA stability assays to determine whether RBM3 controls ILC2 function by stabilizing Th2 cytokine mRNAs. We expect to find that RMB3 promotes ILC2 Th2 cytokine mRNA stability and controls ILC2 Th2 cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. The novelty of the proposed studies includes use of novel reagents (RBM3-/-, RBM3-/-RAG2-/-, and RBM3-/-/YFP-IL-13 reporter mice) and uncovering a novel pathway (RNA binding protein) regulating a recently discovered cell type (ILC2) that contributes to allergic inflammation. Importantly, the discovery of molecules that regulate ILC2 function may reveal novel therapeutic targets to reduce ILC2 activation in asthma and allergic disease.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The first neuroanatomical sex difference in mammals was reported in 1978, and named the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) due to its larger size in males compared to females. The SDN is located within the preoptic area (POA), a region critical to copulatory and maternal behaviors. Studies of these differences in SDN volume have established that males and females generate the same number of neurons in this brain region early in development. However, the lack of estradiol in females causes neurons in the SDN to selectively die off early in life, whereas the production of estradiol from precursor androgens in males exerts a neuroprotective effect. A mechanistic explanation for the neuroprotective effects of estradiol in this system is currently unknown. Recent discoveries on the critical role of non-neuronal cells, such as microglia, in sculpting the developing brain have led us to explore the role of these cells in development of sex differences in neuronal architecture. Our lab has demonstrated that microglia are essential for the masculinization of spine density on dendrites of POA neurons, as well as male copulatory behavior. I recently discovered that the female POA contains a higher percentage of surveying phagocytic microglia than the male POA. I speculate that robust volumetric sex differences in the SDN are achieved by this higher percentage of phagocytic microglia in the female SDN. Current evidence suggests that microglia play a crucial role in phagoptosis (engulfment of stressed, but viable cells) as well as phagocytosis (engulfment of dead cells) during development. This notion, coupled with the known role of estradiol in this system, has led me to predict that estradiol suppresses microglial phagoptosis in the male SDN, rather than preventing conventional neuron-initiated apoptosis. We anticipate that microglia are the initiators of the apoptotic events in females, where there is an absence of estradiol. We have proposed the following aims to test this hypothesis: 1.1) Identify the critical period for microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN. 1.2) Determine the impact of estradiol on microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN 2.1) Determine the cellular targets of microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN and 2.2) Determine the role of microglia (phagoptosis versus conventional phagocytosis) in establishing the sex difference in size of the SDN. Completion of the experiments proposed will challenge the dogma that estradiol prevents neuronal apoptosis in the male SDN; and reveal novel hormone and neuroimmune mechanisms that regulate apoptotic and neuroprotective cascades during normal brain development. Understanding these mechanisms will not only facilitate studies of sex differences in other brain regions, but may also lead to novel insights into windows of vulnerability during development. &#232;?More specifically, perinatal hypoxic events are more frequently associated with an increased risk of brain damage in males compared to females. The results of the proposed studies will provide new information on the neuroprotective roles of immune cells and hormones, and potential sex differences in efficacy of estradiol and/or microglial inhibitors as neuroprotective agents.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis leads to encephalitis (TE) and is one of the most common life threatening central nervous system infections in HIV infected patients. Although incidence as a result of cART therapy has decreased substantially, it continues to be a problem in countries with high prevalence of infection. It is believed that reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis occurs during advanced stages of HIV infection, when CD8 T cell response is compromised. In mouse model of encephalitis, we have reported severe dysfunctionality in memory CD8+ T cell population due to graded up- regulation of PD-1 (a well-known inhibitory molecule) expression on these cells. Although PD-1-PDL-1 blockade invigorated CD8+ T cell response, highly exhausted memory CD8+ T cells could not be rescued. Preliminary data for the proposal demonstrates that in addition to PD-1, CD8+ T cells from susceptible animals exhibited increased expression of other inhibitory molecules like LAG-3, 2B4 and CTLA-4. Thus blockade of multiple inhibitors may be needed to restore the functionality of memory CD8+ T cells. Further, to develop effective therapies against this chronic infection, mechanism responsible for CD8 dysfunction needs to be defined. The proposal has three specific aims. In aim 1, kinetics and pattern of multiple inhibitory receptors expressed by memory CD8+ T cells from infected animals will be performed. This will provide important information about the antibody cocktail needed for reversing the dysfunctionality in this population. In aim 2, the mechanism of memory CD8+ T cell dysfunction during chronic toxoplasma infection will be evaluated. Based on our preliminary findings, in this specific aim the
mechanism involved in the IL-21 mediated maintenance of CD8+T functionality will be deciphered. Finally in the third aim, underlying causes responsible for decreased IL-21 response in animals susceptible to TE with reference to CD40 signaling will be performed. Information generated from these studies will be highly beneficial to develop therapeutic regimen that will enable to maintain robust CD8+T cell memory against chronic toxoplasma infection, which continues to be a serious problem for HIV, infected population.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids in the artery wall, and is an inflammatory disease in which several immune effectors including macrophages play a central role. Obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia are all major risk factors for CVD, but the mechanisms that link disordered metabolism to inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis remain to be elucidated. Our published work and preliminary data demonstrate that the double stranded RNA activated protein kinase, PKR, is activated in the context of obesity, where it plays a critica role in driving inflammation and the deterioration of glucose homeostasis. In macrophages, exposure to lipotoxic signals and lipoproteins activate PKR. In addition, PKR is a critical component for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and stress signaling pathways such as JNK, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of both diabetes and atherosclerosis. In addition, in supporting data presented in this proposal we demonstrate a significant protection against atherosclerotic plaque development in PKR-deficient mice. Based on these findings our overarching hypothesis is that by modulating inflammatory activity, insulin action, and protein synthesis, PKR links cellular stress and metabolic signals to chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis. The experiments described in this proposal will test that hypothesis by determining the role of PKR in the activation and function of macrophages, and by assessing the whole body and macrophage-specific requirement for PKR in the development of atherosclerosis in vivo. This contribution will expand our understanding of the link between nutrient stress and the development of cardiometabolic disease. The innovation of this work lies in investigating a novel approach to atherosclerosis therapy by identifying the mechanistic link between dyslipidemia and inflammatory activation of immune cells.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ventricular tachycardia (VT) causes about 400,000 out-of-hospital sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United States. An important therapeutic strategy is to interrupt the arrhythmic circuit by catheter ablation of the culprit tissue. The staus quo of VT ablation is tightly interwoven with a catheter mapping procedure that assembles voltage and/or activation maps point-by-point on the heart surface. This mapping procedure is invasive, time-consuming, lacking complete 3D data beneath the heart surface, and limited in spatial resolution. With this practice, physicians are engaged in a prolonged clinical procedure to acquire information at only limited sites where the catheter tip is placed. These fundamental limitations have contributed to high recurrence and high complication rates of VT ablation. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a noninvasive transmural electrophysiological imaging (TEPI) system to map ventricular arrhythmia and to provide pre-procedural planning of VT ablation. Based on our strong preliminary data, the overall objective of this proposal is to optimize and determine the clinical value of TEPI in two critical pre-ablatin utilities. First, we will determine the performance of TEPI in electroanatomical scar imaging and in predicting the inducibility of TEPI. Our hypothesis is that, in comparison to invasive electroanatomical voltage mapping, noninvasive TEPI is more consistent with delayed contrast-enhanced imaging in scar delineation and its scar metrics are more predictive of VT inducibility. Second, we will determine the ability of TEPI to map ventricular arrhythmia and to predict ablation targets. Our hypothesis is that TEPI can be used to map ventricular arrhythmia and identify successful ablation sites. These investigations will be carried out in detailed animal models using post-infarction porcine hearts, involving collaborations between an interdisciplinary team of computational, experimental, and clinical scientists. At the completion of this project, we will be able to determine the clinical utility of TEPI in VT ablation, and to generate important pilot data for designing a R01 clinical study with increased statistical power. We will obtain a noninvasive, transmural, and high-resolution imaging tool to characterize both the substrate and dynamics of ventricular arrhythmia, which is expected to improve the clinical outcome of VT ablation by providing better pre-procedural planning and targeting. In the long term, this research will contribute to the fundamental change of clinical electrophysiological studies from being invasive, surface-based, and point-by-point to being noninvasive, transmural, and high-resolution. It will improve the efficacy and safety of electrophysiological study while reducing its duration and cost in routine clinical practice for a broader spectrum of heart rhythm disorders.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While multiple cardiac progenitor cell populations expressing cKit+ appear to be robust platforms for cardiac repair, considerable controversy exists regarding the role of myocyte regeneration from direct differentiation of cKit+ cells vs. their ability to stimulate endogenous myocyte proliferation. In rodent infarcts, cKit+/Lin- cardiac
stem cells (CSCs) isolated from atrial biopsies differentiate into new myocytes with myocardium arising from the transplanted CSCs. In contrast, we and others demonstrated that cKit+ cardiosphere derived cells (CDCs) isolated from ventricular biopsies facilitate repair indirectly b stimulating endogenous myocyte proliferation. Small clinical trials demonstrate favorable effects of both approaches in reducing scar volume and increasing myocardial mass yet differ in that CSCs improve ejection fraction whereas CDCs do not. A major gap in our understanding exists due to the paucity of preclinical studies performed in large animals addressing fundamental questions related to the number and sources of new myocytes. Completed work by our laboratory has demonstrated the feasibility of accomplishing this using allogeneic CDC transplants in sex mismatched donors. Accordingly, we will use allogeneic cells with immunosuppression in a blinded trial design to address the central hypothesis that uncommitted cKit+/Lin- atrial CSCs elicit cardiac regeneration by directly producing new myocytes while cKit+ CDCs committed to a cardiac lineage elicit cardiac repair by stimulating endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation. Using a translational large animal model of a healed infarction in miniswine with chronic LV dysfunction we will employ global intracoronary stem cell infusion without transiently occluding the coronary artery and evaluate the impact of infusing cells to dysfunctional remote regions as well as the infarct to address three Specific Aims: Aim 1 will determine whether allogeneic atrial cKit+ CSCs administered with cyclosporine can improve myocardial function to the same extent as autologous CSCs and com- pare their effectiveness to allogeneic ventricular cKit+ CDCs; Aim 2 will quantify the contribution of myocytes derived from CSCs and CDCs to myocyte regeneration using a lentiviral triple reporter gene construct (PET, fluorescence, bioluminescence), sex mismatched donor/recipients, immunohistochemistry and morphometry ; Aim 3 will evaluate whether endogenous myocyte proliferation is the major mechanism in cKit+ stem cell repair by determining whether cyclosporine immunosuppression can be discontinued after eliciting functional improvement with allogeneic cKit+ CSCs and CDCs. The studies will provide quantitative insight comparing the ability of two competing cKit+ stem cell platforms to regenerate new myocytes in an animal model with a heart size and characteristics similar to patients. The project has high translational significance since demonstrating the feasibility to use cKit+ CDCs or CSCs from an allogeneic donor would provide an off-the-shelf approach for cardiac stem cell therapy. This could be implemented using standard cardiac catheterization approaches and make cardiac cell therapy widely available to treat patients with ischemic heart disease.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ectromelia virus (ECTV), the cause of mousepox, is the prototypical representative of a large class of pathogens that invade the host via lymphohematogenous spread and an outstanding model for the study of natural virus:host interplay. ECTV poses a formidable challenge to the host and numerous arms of the host defense system are required to bring it under control. This includes CD4+ T cells (TCD4+) that, through recognition of foreign peptides (epitopes) in combination with Major Histocompatility Complex class II molecules (MHCII), guide and potentiate adaptive responses and, in some cases, carry out their own effector functions.  Much of what we understand about TCD4+ activation, effector function and memory has been deduced through the use of nominal protein antigens with limited relevance to bona fide pathogens. In fact, preliminary and established data indicate that TCD4+ activation is a complex proposition with the possibility of peptide production via an array of alternative pathways, all of which are quite distinct from the classical textbook versions of antigen processing, and which we hypothesize to be major determinants of TCD4+ expansion and functionality. This notion will be tested in our next steps towards gaining a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the TCD4+ response in a natural virus-host relationship, our long-term goal. To these ends we will: 1) markedly expand the number of known peptide sequences that induce TCD4+ responses to ECTV in C57Bl/6 (B6) mice and determine the processing pathways by which they are generated, 2) identify the antigen presenting cells that present particular ECTV epitopes, and 3) determine impact of processing pathway on TCD4+ expansion and functionality.  The proposed experiments could revise fundamental principles of adaptive immunity, thereby leading to innovations in rational vaccine design.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of gene networks that allow fungal pathogens to successfully interpret and respond to the host environment is rudimentary, and lags behind the more sophisticated knowledge of regulatory circuits that govern virulence of bacterial and viral pathogens. We seek to exploit tools we have developed in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans to approach this question. C. neoformans is an opportunistic yeast pathogen responsible for over 1 million infections and 600,000 deaths annually. In published studies, we identified several transcriptional regulators that control pathogen fitness in infected mice. Pivotal among these is the Gat201 GATA family protein that controls virulence, capsule formation, and the ability to inhibit phagocytosis. We recently determined that Gat201 controls the response of ~16% of the C. neoformans genome to environmental signals. To identify its direct targets we have developed chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray (ChIP-chip) methods for C. neoformans. Among the genes that are directly bound and regulated by Gat201 are seven transcription factors, suggesting the existence of a transcriptional network. Two of these regulators (Liv3 and Cir1) have been implicated in pathogenicity and we have recently demonstrated that another, Gat204, controls fitness during infection of mice and the inhibition of phagocytosis in vitro. These data suggest that C. neoformans implements a network involving at least four regulators to control virulence. We seek to understand how this network functions. Characterizing targets of this network additionally provides an opportunity to identify novel virulence mechanisms. We seek to identify the mechanisms the network must activate to promote disease. Thus, our aims are as follows: (1) Determine the architecture and functional properties of the Gat201 virulence network. We will define the direct and indirect transcriptional targets of each regulator. Analysis of the network architecture is expected to yield testable predictions that could not be inferred from the study of individual regulators. In parallel, we will determine whether these transcriptional regulators have similar or distinct roles in infection. By delineating the functions of the key transcription factors that control virulence and their relationships to each other and target genes, these studies are anticipated to reveal how regulatory factors collaborate to control the virulence properties of the pathogen. (2) Exploit the regulatory network to identify novel capsule-independent virulence mechanisms. Intriguingly, Gat201 activates the expression of genes coding for three enzymes involved in chitin synthesis. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that Gat201 activates the production of chitin and/or chitin-derived polysaccharides and that these are necessary for C. neoformans to inhibit phagocytosis by macrophages thereby promoting virulence. Should we disprove this hypothesis, an alternative approach will be taken in which we test knockouts in targets of the regulatory network. These studies are anticipated to reveal novel mechanisms whose activation by the network is necessary for pathogen success.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Immunotherapy, which focuses on augmenting host immunity against tumor-associated antigens, represents an important means to treat cancer that is yielding clinical success. Successful manipulation of T cell responses requires understanding how particular T cell subsets influence cancer development and growth. For example, Th1 and Th17 cells can augment tumorigenesis. Treg cells can block anti-tumor immune responses and thus represents one of the main obstacles to successful tumor immunotherapy. While Tregs are recognized as tumor supporting cells, the relationship between Th17 cells and tumor immunity has been controversial.     
       A major unappreciated element in T cell fate decisions is the metabolic environment. As part of an effort to study the metabolic regulation of T cell differentiation decisions, we have discovered that hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a critical role in driving the Th17 response. Further preliminary results suggest that lack of this molecule results in reduced tumor initiation and progression. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) further dissect the role of HIF-1 in Th17 development. We will address the breadth, and particular facets of HIF-1's contribution to the Th17 lineage. We will also touch on the suitability of HIF-1 as a therapeutic target in humans; (2) we will explore the role of HIF-1 in regulating the Th17 and Treg responses in inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and cancer progression; (3) we will subsequently use these in vivo cancer models to test the therapeutic potential of HIF-1 targeting. In these studies mice will be treated with the HIF-1 inhibitors, Digoxin and Acriflavine and we will evaluate the ability of these compounds to impede tumor growth either alone or in concert with Treg depletion. Such a strategy is expected to have potent anti-tumor effects as it should, given our preliminary data and past results, simultaneously sabotage two major tumor- promoting immune cell populations]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Artificial Pancreas (AP) closed loop (CL), glucose-sensitive insulin delivery in patients with insulin deficient type 1 diabetes (T1DM) holds promise in restoring euglycemia and thus decreasing long-term complication related to diabetes. Major impediments to the AP application are post-prandial hyperglycemia and post-absorptive hypoglycemia. Glucagon, an alpha cell hormone is a first-line counter-regulatory hormone released during hypoglycemia increases hepatic glucose production and is normally suppressed in the post-prandial period. In diabetes, in addition to insulin deficiency there is glucagon dysregulation. Paradoxical hyperglucagonemia and hyperglycemia after a meal and failure of glucagon to increase in response to hypoglycemia make AP treatment difficult with insulin monotherapy or more complicated if there were dual or triple hormonal infusion required. For the last decade we have investigated various glucagon suppressors' amylin, GLP-1 and sitagliptin to combat this problem. We have demonstrated that exenatide, an injectable glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor analog is very effective in reducing post-prandial hyperglycemia in the CL setting. Currently we are comparing exenatide to liraglutide (another long acting GLP-1 analog) in CL setting. We propose a novel approach to combating both hyper and hypoglycemia by introducing adjuvant sitagliptin, an FDA approved drug, which is given once daily as a pill. Sitagliptin acts by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) the enzyme that metabolizes GLP-1 and increasing endogenous GLP-1. GLP-1 suppresses post-prandial hyperglycemia. In protocol 1, we will test 2 doses of sitagliptin to study its effect on post-prandal hyperglycemia and hyperglucagonemia in the CL setting. Vildagliptin (DPP4 inhibitor not US approved) increases glucagon in response to insulin- induced-hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin remains to be tested for this effect. In protocol 2, we will compare the effect of exenatide vs. sitaglipti on glucagon secretion during a hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp. Lastly, in protocol 3, we will compare the effects of exenatide to sitagliptin in the closed loop system to determine which analog is most beneficial to patients. The overarching goal of this application is to find the best 
and simplest way to overcome hyper and hypoglycemia associated with the treatment of diabetes. Medtronic, a leader in the development of closed-loop system technology for glucose control and Dr. Heptulla have pioneered adjunctive treatment of T1DM with the use of glucagon suppressors. These protocols aim to understand the pathogenesis and treatment of glucagon dysregulation in diabetes. They aim to simplify treatment and use the best glucagon suppressor for glucose regulation in AP.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Members of the genus Flaviviruses, such as West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue virus, are human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality in ever-widening geographic areas of the world. Currently, there are few vaccines and no available efficacious antiviral therapies for flaviviruses. A Mendelian dominant allele of the Flv gene that was first discovered in mice in the 1920's reduces the replication efficiency of all members of the genus Flavivirus so far tested and confers resistance to flavivirus-induced disease. Resistant mice display no symptoms even after an intracerebral injection of a flavivirus dose that kills 100% of congenic susceptible mice.
Viral attachment and entry are not blocked but intracellular viral RNA levels and extracellular virus production are reduced in resistant cells. The Flv locus was subsequently identified as the Oas1b gene. Susceptible mice express a truncated Oas1b protein due to the presence of a premature stop codon. Replacement of the susceptible Oas1b allele by knock-in of the Oas1b resistance allele using targeted homologous recombination converted susceptible C57BL/6 mice to the resistant phenotype. Oas1b is a member of the 2-5A synthetase family but the products of both alleles of this gene are inactive synthetases. The unique flavivirus-specific antiviral activity of Oas1b is not dependent on the canonical RNase L pathway. The recent identification of cell partners for Oas1b has provided new directions for gaining an understanding of this novel, natural, flavivirus-specific antiviral mechanism. Preliminary data for
one of the Oas1b binding partners, ABCF3, indicate that it is specifically involved in the flavivirus-resistance mechanism and that it may also be involved in regulating the canonical Oas-RNase L pathway. Functional contributions of the Oas1b binding partners to the flavivirus-specific resistance phenotype and for one of the partners, a contribution to a broad spectrum antiviral pathway will be studied under three specific aims. Aim 1: Characterization of the resistance phenotype in various types of cell cultures and functional analyses of the involvement of Oas1b partner proteins in the flavivirus resistance mechanism. Aim 2: Characterization of the resistance phenotype in mouse brains and analysis of the requirement of ABCF3 for the Oas1b-mediated, flavivirus-specific resistance phenotype in mice. Aim 3: Functional analysis of the interaction of ABCF3 with the active 2-5A synthetase Oas1a. This project will provide new knowledge about a novel, naturally-occurring, genetically-controlled, flavivirus-specific disease resistance mechanism in mice as well as reveal new information about the unique step in the flavivirus replication cycle that is affected by this resistance mechanism. This information is expected to identify new cell targets for the development of pan-flavivirus antiviral therapeutics.
New insights about the regulation of the Oas-RNase L pathway will also be obtained.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Corneal & retinal angiogenesis are driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and are key events in corneal transplant rejection, trauma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. Current treatments for these conditions rely on chronic monthly injections of anti-VEGF agents (e.g., Avastin(R); Lucentis(R)) into the eye, with attendant risks of hemorrhage and infection. We propose to suppress VEGF using a sustained-release, intracellular, anti-angiogenic strategy. This strategy uses morpholinos which shift VEG receptor 1 or 2 (Flt-1 or KDR, respectively) expression towards their soluble isoform, essentially inhibitin membrane-bound receptor expression and increasing expression of soluble, decoy receptors. This strategy has potential benefit for treating corneal transplant rejection, macular degeneration
and other ocular vascular disorders.  During the prior funding period, we used biodegradable, nontoxic, albumin nanoparticles containing plasmids expressing anti-VEGF molecules to sustain angioinhibition for up to 6 weeks. We will next advance nanoparticle delivery through conjugation with transferrin (to facilitate topical delivery) or with arginine-glycine- aspartic acd (RGD) oligopeptides (to home to neovascular tissues). Targeted delivery of anti-angiogenics to block VEGF intracellularly selectively in neovascular tissues is a significant unmet medical need as recent data indicate that long-term use of intravitreal ranibizumab (the widely used anti-VEGF Fab fragment, which binds VEGF extracellularly) is associated with a 30% risk of developing geographic atrophy within 2 years and over 50% risk at 7 years. Based on the above rationale, our central hypotheses are that:  [a] expression of morpholinos promoting soluble VEGF receptors, will inhibit corneal transplant rejection  and choroidal neovascularization; and  [b] nanoparticle-morpholino therapy may reduce fibrosis or atrophy. Our specific aims are to test the following predictions based on the above hypotheses:  1. Morpholinos will inhibit angiogenesis and rejection of corneal transplants. We will test delivery using  intracorneal and subconjunctival injections, as well as topical delivery of nanoparticles designed to cross  the corneal epithelium.  2. Targeted nanoparticles delivering morpholinos can inhibit and regress choroidal neovascularization  (CNV) in laser-induced and transgenic models  3. Long-term nanoparticle-mediated expression of morpholinos inhibits fibrosis and induces less atrophy  in corneal transplants and choroidal neovascularization.  The results of these studies will define whether intracellular anti-angiogenic therapy can inhibit corneal  rejection and macular degeneration, and demonstrate the potential of nanoparticles for long-term anti-  angiogenic therapy either by topical routes for corneal disease or targeted systemic delivery for age related 
macular degeneration. These may enable new treatment modalities which avoid the risks of current  standard of care.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this project application are two-fold. First, this project aims to advance the principal investigator's scientific training and career development as a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Professor Michael Gilmore at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Second, this project aims to investigate the molecular biology of a unique toxin, called cytolysin, which is produced by Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. With the advent of antibiotic therapy, E. faecalis has transformed from a prominent member of the commensal gut microbiota into a multi-drug resistant, hospital-acquired pathogen. Highly virulent strains of E. faecalis express a pore-forming exotoxin called cytolysin, which lyses both bacterial and eukaryotic cells in response to quorum signals. Originally described in the 1930s, the cytolysin is a member of a large class of lanthionine-containing bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria. While the cytolysin shares some core features with other lantibiotics, it possesses unique characteristics as well. Importantly, little is currently known about how expression of the individual genes within the cytolysin operon is controlled, as well as the precise function of the final gene in the operon, the cytolysin immunity factor cylI.  The long-ter objectives of this research project are to better understand the mechanisms of cytolysin expression and immunity, in order to better treat and control highly virulent, hospital-acquired E.
faecalis infections. The first aim of this project is to: 1. Establish how the cytolysin operon is regulated transcriptionally. To carry out this aim, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) will be conducted in order to: map the transcription start sites of all cytolysin operon transcripts, identify antisese and processed mRNA transcripts that may regulate the cytolysin operon, and identify genes that show differential expression in bacterial strains that do or do not harbor the cytolysin operon, and between the uninduced and induced states of cytolysin expression. The second aim of this project is to: 2. Characterize the product of the immunity gene cylI, and determine how immunity to cytolysin is transferred between cells. To carry out this aim, the function and substrate preferences for the CylI protein will be determined using both in vitro and whole cell assays. Additionally, a cytolysin transfer assay will be developed in order to determine the timing, conditions, and efficiency of cytolysin operon transfer. Overall, this project will advance understanding of the basic biological mechanisms of an important human pathogen, while simultaneously providing an enriching and worthwhile experience to the principal investigator.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aims of this study specifically address two of the research objectives outlined in NIDDK's Strategic Plan for the Scientific Community: 1) combine new technology for diabetes management with behavioral and translational research; and 2) mitigate psychosocial complications and comorbidities of diabetes to improve quality of life. NIDDK recognizes that research is needed to develop behavioral approaches to improve family function, and ultimately metabolic control in the patient and to determine the most effective ways to translate strategies [to improve adherence] into routine pediatric care. This K23 study is significant because it addresses the critical need for improving insulin pump adherence where non-adherence has severe and potentially life threatening consequences. Continued misuse of insulin pumps compromises the health of patients with T1D and the ability of physicians to provide effective treatment. If the aims of this project are achieved, this study will change insuln pump practices by providing a comprehensive assessment approach relevant to insulin pump use. In addition, this study's use of a highly efficient experimental design to determine effective
intervention components should lead to a cost-effective, clinic-based intervention to improve insulin pump adherence. This project is innovative because it: 1) objectively measures insulin pump adherence data, which is rare in the extant diabetes literature; 2) develops an insulin pump assessment protocol that targets insulin pump knowledge/skills and BGM-BOLUS adherence behaviors that can be used in the clinical setting; and 3) uses a methodological approach for optimizing intervention components to be delivered at point of care. This study also explores modifiable barriers that could potentially interfere with effective insulin pump use including fear of hypoglycemia, adolescent responsibility, and depression, and could be incorporated into future interventions. The specific aims of this study are: 1) develop an insulin pump assessment protocol focused on knowledge/skills relevant to BGM-BOLUS adherence behaviors; 2) use a highly efficient experimental design to determine whether the two components of the Pump It Up! Intervention, Personalized Insulin Pump Feedback and Insulin Pump Problem-Solving, are effective at improving BGM-BOLUS adherence behaviors; and 3) identify moderators associated with BGM- BOLUS adherence behaviors. My overall goal is to become an independent, patient-oriented clinical researcher in T1D by establishing an independent line of research focused on understanding the modifiable barriers associated with suboptimal BGM and insulin adherence, which can be improved through the implementation of innovative interventions during the routine care of patients with T1D. I plan to focus on pediatric
patients who use insulin pumps as this population has been understudied in the extant literature. This K23 proposal will provide the necessary foundation for my transition to an independent researcher in T1D. I have several qualifications that make me an ideal Candidate for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. I am a licensed clinical psychologist with a strong scientific background in evidence-based treatments. I was a recipient of an NIDDK supported T32 postdoctoral NRSA and the NIH Pediatric Loan Repayment Program. I am fully committed to establishing my academic research career in T1D and am well-prepared to capitalize on a K23 award. I have spent the first years of my faculty position designing and conducting preliminary studies in T1D, establishing important collaborative relationships with endocrinologists, and publishing articles in T1D. I have carefully
chosen a mentorship/consulting team that will facilitate my transition to an independent academic research career in T1D. My primary mentor on this award is Dr. Suzanne Bennett Johnson, a well- established pediatric psychologist with expertise in T1D, adherence, and clinical trials with more than 30 years of NIH funding. Dr. Larry Deeb, co-Mentor, is a pediatric endocrinologist and past President of the American Diabetes Association. Consultants include Dr. Roger Mazze, an expert in technological advancements associated with T1D care; Dr. Linda Collins, an expert in innovative methodologies and intervention techniques; and Dr. Daniel McGee, an expert in sophisticated measurement and statistical models and longitudinal data analysis. The environment at the Florida State University College of Medicine is rich in resources that support my early career development including space to conduct research and house research staff, state-of-the-art library and information technology facilities, and additiona funds to complete the project if necessary. The faculty in my department is prolific with regard to
publications and securing extramural funding. The goals contained in my training plan include: 1) develop expertise in the pathophysiology, medical management, and psychosocial factors of T1D; 2) develop expertise in the objective measurement of T1D treatment regimen adherence; 3) extend knowledge of innovative statistical approaches involving BGM and insulin pump technology data; 4) develop expertise in innovative methodological approaches; and 5) augment scientific writing skills. The combination of my training and research plan and mentoring/collaborative team who have a long history of NIH funding assures that the training and scientific goals of this application will be met and that I will become and independent academic T1D researcher.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes is now relatively commonplace, and a heterogeneous mixture of electrophysiological phenotypes is generally obtained. The relative proportions of the 3 major phenotypes (nodal-like, atrial-like and ventricular-like) have been widely reported for various differentiation methods and cell lines, and is crucial information in determining their suitabilityfor any given application. However, such assessments are generally obtained by subjective evaluation, and in the few instances where quantitative measures have been used, classification was based on ad-hoc criteria using only a few parameters. To significantly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the phenotypic analysis, we will utilize the entire action potential shape and employ advanced image analysis and machine learning methods in an automated computational algorithm. This algorithm will be used to classify the electrophysiological phenotypes of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) grown in culture, and optimized by using molecular identifiers.  The specific aims of the project are to: (1 obtain archetypal electrophysiological datasets of human ventricular, atrial and nodal cells, and (2) use image analysis and machine learning methods to classify hESC-CM phenotypes. To achieve these aims, we will use computational models of the 3 major subtypes of the heart as reference points for our classification algorithm, multi-site optical measurements of action potentials, molecular and pharmacological indicators of subtype, and metamorphosis distance as a quantitative measure of the dissimilarity between action potentials. In summary, this project will result in a standardized, objective and automated computational method to classify the relative amounts of the 3 major electrophysiological phenotypes in populations of hESC-CMs, as well as the development of an action potential ontology.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION    
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) due to exposure to explosive blasts is a common occurrence in veterans  returning from recent deployments. Although mTBI is not associated with gross brain damage visible on  standard radiological examinations, a subset of individuals report long-term disruptions of cognitive and  emotional functioning, suggesting that more subtle neural damage may exist. Given results from civilian mTBI,  the damage is likely to be spatially variable across individuals and to affect white matter (WM) tracts  connecting distant brain regions. Therefore, measures of brain connectivity may be vital for understanding the  neurological effects of deployment-related mTBI (dTBI). In particular, quantification of changes in brain  connectivity, rather than simply end-state differences, associated with dTBI may be especially informative.   The proposed research plan will investigate deployment-related changes in MRI-based measures of  structural and functional connectivity, as well as clinical and neuropsychological measures, in a population of  military service members being deployed for the first time. The effect of dTBI on these changes will be tested  as well as potential moderating
effects of combat stress and other deployment experiences. In addition, the  presence of baseline differences in connectivity measures and the effect of these differences on deployment-  related changes will be investigated. The overall goals of the proposed research plan are to characterize the  neural effects of blast mTBI on brain connectivity and the potential moderating effects of pre-deployment and  in-theater factors by pursuing the following aims:   Aim 1: To investigate the longitudinal effects of dTBI and deployment experiences on brain connectivity  and cognitive performance, as well as the inter-relationships among these changes.   Aim 2: To investigate the effects of factors present prior to deployment (e.g. history of civilian mTBI) on pre-  deployment brain connectivity and longitudinal changes in connectivity and cognition.   The most unique elements of this research plan are the inclusion of neuroimaging data from service  members with no prior deployment, the collection of pre- and post-deployment longitudinal neuroimaging data,  and the explicit examination of relationships among changes in structural connectivity, functional connectivity,  and neuropsychological measures. These elements allow the neural changes associated with deployment in general and bTBI in particular to be characterized in a comprehensive manner.   The candidate seeks to use this Career Development experience to build on his existing expertise using  neuroimaging methods to study clinical conditions, to develop his skills in clinical assessment of TBI and  related conditions, to provide opportunities for VA service, and to establish a rich set of resources for  establishing an independent research career within VA. He will accomplish this by working closely with his  mentors, administering neuropsychological tests in research and clinical settings, and providing educational,  academic, and clinical service to a range of VA centers. The candidate will meet regularly with his mentors  throughout the study period to use their wealth of experience to ensure that the study is designed and  implemented in a manner most likely to accomplish the proposed aims, contribute to veterans' care, and build  a pool of resources that will fuel applications for future funded research. He will engage in a range of training  activities that combine coursework with direct patient contact, as well as service activities that include  education of clinicians and military leadership, participation in administrative committees (e.g. IRB), and  integration of research and clinical aims of the Minneapolis Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center. In addition to  providing necessary training and experience in conditions of high relevance to veteran care, these activities will  help Dr. Davenport integrate himself with the resources available at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System  that will be used to establish an independent VA research career.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is the most
common form of acute organ dysfunction in the hospital, and is often associated with multiple
organ failure (MOF), high mortality, and functional impairment. Most studies on ARF have
focused on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) after they have been on mechanical
ventilation for days and end organ damage is already established. The overall goal of this
proposed project is to improve the outcomes of patients at high risk for developing severe ARF
and prolonged mechanical ventilation in and outside of the ICU. The project aims to intervene
early in high risk patients with an electronic medical records (EMR)-based, patient-centered
checklist of common critical care practices aimed at preventing lung injury and hospital acquired
adverse events that commonly lead to organ failure (Prevention of Organ Failure checklist -
PROOFcheck). This application proposes a stepped-wedge, clustered randomized control trial
to determine the utility of PROOFcheck to improve survival and reduce the duration of
mechanical ventilation and multiple organ failure in patients identified as high risk for
progressing to severe ARF and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The aims in the UH2 phase
are: 1) to refine a previously validated Lung Injury Prediction Score into a pragmatic, EMR-
based early prediction model to Accurately Predict Prolonged Ventilation (APPROVE), which
will automatically identify patients anywhere in the hospital who are at high risk for developing
severe ARF requiring mechanical ventilation >48 hours; 2) to incorporate PROOFcheck into the
EMR to prompt clinicians on care practices to limit lung injury, prevent adverse events, and
avoid additional organ failure; and 3) to establish the infrastructure for the proposed trial. The
proposed pragmatic trial will harness the hospital-wide EMR to identify patients at high risk for
prolonged mechanical ventilation with APPROVE for intervention with PROOFcheck. As such,
the proposed trial aims to break out of the clinical silos by which care is currently organized in
the hospital and bring patient-centered, context appropriate care to the acutely ill patient
wherever and whenever the patient's condition requires it.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We study Salmonella-host interactions and have shown that a host regulator of fatty acid metabolism, PPAR?, controls persistent systemic S. Typhimurium infection in mice. PPAR?, a transcriptional factor that plays a role in regulating metabolic and immune pathways, is specifically upregulated in Salmonella- infected macrophages. Importantly, PPAR?-deficient mice are not chronically infected with S. Typhimurium. The long-term goal of this research proposal is to understand how S. Typhimurium usurps and manipulates host metabolic and immune activities during chronic infection. In Aim 1, we will use genetic and biochemical approaches to identify mechanisms of Salmonella-dependent activation of PPAR?. In Aim 2, we will identify the PPAR?-dependent immune and metabolic pathways required for Salmonella replication in macrophages. In Aim 3, we will use germ-free mice and mice deficient for PPAR? in macrophages or gut epithelial cells to characterize PPAR?-dependent mechanisms of Salmonella persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. These studies are aimed at gaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions during chronic infections, which will lead to the rational design of therapeutics that will benefit public health.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Xiaoxia Li, Ph.D., Project Leader
Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity is a crucial public health problem that is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and cardiovascular
disease, affecting 25% of the population and its incidence is growing. IL-1R/TLRs have been directly implicated in
obesity-associated inflammatory diseases. TLR2 or TLR4 deficiency reduced diet-induced insulin resistance and
atherosclerosis, while human TLR4 null mutations are associated with reduced risk of atherosclerosis. The overall
objective of this proposal is to elucidate IL-1R/TLR-mediated signaling mechanisms in the inflammatory response
associated with metabolic diseases. Our long-term goals are to identify new therapeutic targets and to develop more
effective anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs. Genetic and biochemical studies by us and others revealed that IL-
1R/TLRs interact with the adaptor MyD88 to initiate TAK1 (TGF&#191;-activated kinase 1)- and MEKK3 (MAP kinase
kinase kinase 3)-dependent pathways. Each pathway involves cascades of kinases organized by multiple adapter
molecules into parallel and sequential signaling complexes, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF&#191;B. IL-
1R/TLRs also mediate mRNA stabilization and promote protein translation of cytokines and chemokines through their
impact on RNA binding proteins and translation mediators (mTOR and MnK1). We have previously shown that the
kinase activity of IRAK4 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) is required for TAK1-dependent NF&#191;B activation and
posttranscriptional induction of cytokines and chemokines, but not for MEKK3-dependent NF&#191;B activation. We have
recently reported that while IRAK1 and IRAK2 interact with MyD88-IRAK4 to mediate TAK1-dependent NF&#191;B
activation and posttranscriptional control respectively; IRAKM (without functional kinase domain) mediates a second
wave of IL-1R-TLR-induced NF&#191;B activation through the MEKK3-dependent pathway, but also attenuates protein
translation of cytokines and chemokines. In this proposal, we propose two Aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the
molecular mechanism of IL-1R/TLRs signaling: (1) Delineate the precise molecular mechanism for IRAK1-mediated
TAK1-dependent NF&#191;B activation; (2) Investigate the mechanisms of IRAK2-mediated posttranscriptional control of
cytokines and chemokines; (3) Elucidate the mechanisms by which IRAKM mediates MEKK3-dependent NF&#191;B
activation and its inhibitory effect on translational control of cytokines and chemokines. In Aim 2, we will investigate
the mechanism of IL-1R/TLRs signaling for the development of obesity-associated diseases: (1) Study how IL-
1R/TLRs signaling mediate the cross-talk between adipocytes and macrophages contributing to diet-induced
systemic inflammation and exacerbation on atherosclerosis; (2) Determine the impact of IL-1R/TLRs signaling in
endothelial cells on the recruitment of monocytes and polarization of inflammatory macrophages.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks funding for the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) at the U of PA (Penn) and the Children's Hosp of Philadelphia (CHOP). Our IDDRC, now in its 25th year, is an inter- disciplinary program that is the chief agency at CHOP/Penn for the promulgation of research into the developmental disabilities. In the next cycle we build upon this foundation by proposing an innovative Center with 6 components: (1) A research project which uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) to develop a novel biomarker - an electronic signature - for non-verbal and minimally verbal children with autistic spectrum disorders; (2) A series of 6 research core facilities which will provide investigators with state-of-the-art facilities and expertise, including 2 new cores (Preclinical Models and Clinical Translational); (3) An educational program which will nurture a feeling of IDD Community by featuring monthly seminars, including the IDDRC Research Lecture, the Monthly Chalk Talks and the Autism Distinguished Lecture Series; (4) A career development initiative which will benefit dozens of exceptional young investigators who will receive support from the IDDRC New Program Development award (to be funded by the Philadelphia Foundation), the IDDRC-administered T32 Training Grant in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities and several private awards (aggregate value ~ $3 million over 5 years) given by local philanthropies to the IDDRC; (5) A research advocacy mission which involves an IDDRC- CHOP/Penn collaboration to create Centers of Excellence that encourage inter-disciplinary translational research into IDD; and (6) Participation in the larger IDDRC Network in order to realize the scientific and organizational goals of the IDD Branch of NICHD. The Center will support 78 federally-funded projects ($23.3 million/yr), of which 15 are from NICHD ($5.8 million/yr). The theme of our IDDRC is Genes, Brain, Behavior, a designation which reflects our ongoing effort to understand IDD in 3 inter-related domains: (a) The genetic anlage which causes a disability or modulates disease severity; (b) The anomalies of brain biochemistry and neurophysiology which accompany genetic changes; and (c) The phenomenological manifestations of these genetic/neurophysiologic alterations which we recognize as clinical manifestations of the IDD. Our rationale for this reductionist approach is that the dissection of
a disability into isolated and simpler components affords a strategy with which to develop therapies that will prevent, attenuate or even reverse the devastating consequences of the disorder. Over the coming 5 years the Center will pursue this aim by deploying these tools: cutting-edge research cores, a focus on translational research, the enormous clinical resources of CHOP/Penn, nurturing a cadre of future leaders, and a strong emphasis on creative partnership with the IDDRC Network.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the understanding of underlying mechanisms, heart failure (HF) remains the major cause of mortality, indicating the urgent need in the development of novel unconventional therapeutic strategies. Abnormal intracellular calcium (Ca2+) handling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant arrhythmias characteristic of Heart Failure (HF). Cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling is mediated through Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), which is controlled by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-sensitive Ca2+ channels, also known as cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2). MicroRNAs (miRs) are ~22-nucleotide-long nonprotein-coding RNAs that recognize their target mRNAs by base pairing interactions and subsequently inhibit gene expression by targeting these mRNAs for translational repression or degradation. Rapidly accumulating evidence implicates dysregulated miRs in cardiac pathogenesis including arrhythmias and HF rendering them new attractive targets for therapy. However, much work must be done for better understanding of miR functions. Our preliminary results implicate a family of miRs specific to muscle tissue called myomiRs in regulation of Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that myomiRs which include miR-208a, miR-208b and miR-499 play a critical role in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis by modulating the structure and function of macromolecular complexes involved in Ca2+ handling. In order to test this hypothesis we have developed techniques to modify the expression of miRNAs in vitro and in intact hearts in vivo in order to examine their effects on Ca2+ cycling in single ventricular myocytes using electrophysiology and single photon laser scanning confocal microscopy. Specifically we aim to investigate the molecular determinants of myomiR-mediated regulation of SR Ca2+ release through RyR2s in ventricular myocytes, and test whether aberrant expression patterns of these miRs contribute to Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias characteristic of cardiac disease using rat model of heart failure.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Jonathan Smith, Ph.D., Project Leader
Project Summary/Abstract
Heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States. Although the incidence of
cardiovascular disease deaths has declined, it still accounts for ~1 out of every 3 deaths. Coronary artery
disease (CAD) due to atherosclerosis was responsible for most of these deaths. Despite increased knowledge
about CAD risk factors and the availably of drugs to treat them, the CAD problem has not been solved. Large
human genome wide association studies have identified many common genetic variants associated with CAD,
but only a small fraction of the heritable risk has been discovered. Here we propose to perform mouse genetic
and genomic studies to identify atherosclerosis modifier genes and genetic modifiers of foam cell lipid droplet
metabolism, yielding insights into the mechanisms that regulate these pathways. These findings may lead to
novel drug targets and therapies to prevent or treat CAD. The first aim of the proposed studies involves
identifying the responsible genes and genetic variation that give rise to the mouse atherosclerosis susceptibility
loci on chromosomes 2 and 17, which we have recently independently replicated. Validation will be performed
by allele replacement, the gold standard method to demonstrate a direct causal effect of genetic variation on a
phenotype. The second aim of the proposed studies involves the study of an intermediate phenotype that we
discovered in atherosclerosis sensitive vs. resistant mice. We found that cholesterol ester stored in lipid droplets
of macrophage foam cells is metabolized by autophagy with hydrolysis mediated by lysosomal acid lipase, such
that the atherosclerosis sensitive strain has lower rates of flux through this pathway, implying that this pathway
is atheroprotective. Thus, we propose to use genetic, genomic, and proteomic studies to identify the genetic
variant responsible for this intermediate phenotype, and validate the causal genetic variant via allele
replacement. Finally, we will probe whether the antiatherogenic effect of mTOR inhibitors in mice is mediated
via an induction of foam cell autophagy.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has emerged as one of the most critical health care problems in the US as 69% of the US population is currently overweight or obese. Adipose tissue dysfunction is an essential hallmark linking obesity to the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disease, and prior work form our group has demonstrated that qualitative properties of adipose tissue shape systemic phenotypes. In particular, impaired adipose tissue angiogenesis in obesity has been associated with inflammation and metabolic dysfunction; however pathogenic mechanisms are incompletely understood. We describe a novel endogenous isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), VEGF-A165b that is selectively over-expressed in obesity and inhibits angiogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that perturbations in the Wnt5a signaling system up-regulates VEGF-A165b under conditions of obesity that is modified by bariatric surgical weight loss. In aim 1, we will examine adipose depot-specific microvascular angiogenic responses in biopsied fat samples from 150 obese and 50 lean subjects. We will characterize VEGF-A isoforms in relation to angiogenic capacity and vascularization. We hypothesize that inhibitory isoform VEGF-A165b will be up- regulated in obesity, associated with anti-angiogenic actions in fat, and relate to whole body metabolic dysfunction. In aim 2, specific inhibitors of Wnt signaling will be employed using human adipose tissue samples secured from aim 1 to provide a molecular framework for understanding the regulation of VEGF-A 165b expression. In aim 3, we will re-examine adipose angiogenic capacity and VEGF isoform expression at 6 months following bariatric surgery in the same 150 obese subjects from aim 1. We will test whether relevant molecular pathways specifically identified in aim 2 are influenced by weight reduction. We seek to identify novel determinants of adipose tissue biology and angiogenesis in relation to metabolic changes which will develop in association with marked weight loss in obese individuals. Our proposal may identify the Wnt5a-VEGF-A 165b axis as a novel modulator of angiogenesis, adipose tissue biology, and consequently, systemic disease in clinical obesity and potentially lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, continues to kill people at an alarming rate. Solving the difficult challenge of emerging resistance to artemisinin (ART)-based combination therapies will take the full set of traditional and innovative new tools. An exciting recent discovery pinpointed mutations in a chromosome 13 gene that encodes a kelch propeller domain as a marker for emerging ART-resistance (ART-R), however nothing is known about its function or its interacting partners. An important step in converting primary knowledge of genome-scale information to understanding the mechanisms of ART-R is the elucidation of the interactions among the component parts of the biological system. Knowledge of these components can guide appropriate interventions to prolong this crucial drug. We outline a novel approach that is robust to 2 main limitations of genome-wide data: false positives and incomplete information. We validate our approach with the gold standard knowledge that pfcrt is the primary determinant of chloroquine (CQ) resistance and demonstrate its utility for dissecting ART-R. After constructing a comprehensive reference transcriptional network, we generated 2 novel and independent query lists: i) genes that are 'rewired', i.e. diverge dramatically in their co- expression relationships, between CQR and CQS parasites and ii) genes interrupted by piggyBac (pB) insertions that exhibit altered drug susceptibility. For each of these richly informative input gene sets, we used the reference network to find nodes that complete a short path connection among many of these genes. The immediate goal of this application is to apply this approach to the urgent and vexing problem of emerging ART- R, by expanding the reference network and determining the top rewired genes using an extraordinary panel of clinical isolates from the Thailand-Myanmar border (Aim 1) and by screening 128 pB mutants and transfected lines for shifts in ART susceptibility and transcriptional response profiles (Aim 2). This information will be used to independently validate candidate genes and predict functional interactions (Aim 3).]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxoplasma gondii is an important protist pathogen of humans. A genome sequence is available but the research community is greatly hampered by critical assembly errors that inhibit the ability of researchers to discover new, and to study known, gene duplications associated with virulence. This proposal focuses on the ascertainment and resolution of genome compressions and assembly errors in the reference genome sequence for Toxoplasma gondii ME49. Copy number variation is linked to differences in phenotype and virulence in many pathogens. The goal of this project is to identify and disambiguate local genome segment duplications that were collapsed/merged as an artifact of current genome assembly algorithms. Bioinformatics analysis of the assembled reference genome sequence for T. gondii strain ME49 reveals no segmental genome duplications, a highly anomalous result indicative of the extent to which replicate regions have been collapsed. In contrast, an analysis of sequence data from 62 T. gondii strains released from the community T. gondii genome project has revealed an excess of SNPs and an excess of sequence reads in many genomic locations when compared to the T. gondii ME49 reference. This finding indicates the existence of multiple repetitive regions in the genome assemblies as well as strain differences in the number of repetitive regions and SNPs each contains. The critical step needed to correct the reference genome sequence and disambiguate replicated regions is to obtain long-read single-molecule sequences (5-10 kb) that span the genome sufficiently well to cover duplicated regions. Two aims are proposed that focus on resolving duplicated genome regions via long-read sequences for several key T. gondii strains with a focus on the reference, ME49. Resolved sequences will be compared with each other to catalog the extent and types of replicated regions. Finally, comparisons of duplicated regions themselves will be used to catalog affected genes. All data will be released to the community via ToxoDB.org and archived appropriately. This study will provide a reference genome sequence with greatly reduced errors and much needed insight in the scope and potential significance of genome duplications in the evolution of Toxoplasma gondii strains.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Project provides a framework for the integration of basic and translational research, by defining basic dimensions of function that cut across disorders. Circadian and sleep disturbances, observed in several highly incapacitating and debilitating mental disorders, represent the key constructs within the Arousal and Regulatory system RDoC Domain. The study of circadian and sleep disturbances in psychiatric populations is difficult and contradictory results between numerous small scale studies may be due to a high degree of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Our long-term aim is to evaluate the feasibility of applying actigraphy for large-scale genetic studies
across traditional diagnostic categories. To facilitate these studies, we need to evaluate novel methods for large scale, longitudinal profiling of activity patterns. Our Aims are: Aim 1. To identify actigraphy devices and establish protocols suitable for concurrent and longitudinal ascertainment of activity and sleep: wake patterns and mood symptoms in 100 subjects recruited from an outpatient mood disorders treatment program; and Aim 2. To test heritability of an array of quantitative parameters collected using actigraphy devices (including activity levels, timing of activity and rest onsets, amplitude, organization of activity-rest cycles) and self- reported mood symptoms in a set of 250 twin pairs from the Pennsylvania Twin Registry. The comparison of individual difference measures and heritability of parameters related to mood, sleep: wake or rest: activity patterns in subjects presenting at the mood clinic and in a set of twins represents will provide important preliminary insights into parameter selection for large scale genetic studies across several disorders. Finally, the RDoC initiative is new and will require an integration of approaches across fields. This proposal will provide an opportunity for the interdisciplinary team (geneticists, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists and statisticians) t initiate RDoC-based phenotyping relevant to sleep and circadian disturbances.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are highly specialized cells that express high levels of SMC-specific proteins, such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC/Myh11) and smooth muscle-?ctin (?A/Acta2)1. Under pathological conditions, however, SMCs are capable of undergoing profound phenotypic and functional changes resulting in a proliferative, inflammatory phenotype. An important paradigm shift in recent years suggests that vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) reside in a specialized niche within the adventitia of postnatal vessels. Adventitial VPCs express several stem cell markers, including Sca1 and CD34, have the capacity to differentiate in vitro into multiple lineages in response to specific signals, and potentially contribute to intimal lesions in vivo. However, important unanswered questions remain, including their origin, their degree of pluripotency and/or heterogeneity, and their contribution to vessel maintenance, repair, and pathological lesion formation. Using an innovative in vivo fate-mapping approach to genetically label mature Myh11- expressing SMC, we definitively established that mature SMCs give rise to the majority of intimal SMCs in response to wire-induced injury. Quite unexpectedly, we made the observation that some mature SMCs reverse migrate into the adventitia, exhibit no detectable expression of SM markers, but gain expression of Sca1 and CD34. We established that a distinct subpopulation of AdvSca1 progenitors arise from mature SMCs through a process we are calling endogenous adventitial reprogramming and suggest these cells play important roles in arterial homeostasis and disease. Our preliminary findings suggest SMC-derived AdvSca1 cells reside in the adventitia and contribute to a heterogeneic population of resident VPCs that possess distinct biological properties and fate decisions. Our overall hypothesis is that mature SMCs are reprogrammed during the later stages of vascular development to a subpopulation of functionally distinct VPCs; reprogramming is dependent at least in part on induction of the transcription factor, Klf4 and loss of the tumor suppressor, PTEN. After vascular injury, mobilization and recruitment of these cells contributes to intimal lesion formation and vessel repair. Our data could have a profound impact on defining the endogenous molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of resident VPCs, which could lead to the potential to manipulate these cells in situ to improve therapeutic applications in settings suc as atherosclerosis/restenosis, aneurysm formation, ischemic tissues, and tumor angiogenesis. Mature macrovessel SMCs, as the source of resident VPCs, involving more than SMC dedifferentiation, but reprogramming to a functional progenitor phenotype, has not been described. Three Aims are proposed to define the differentiation potential and response of SMC- derived VPCs to vascular injury (Aim One), to define the role of Klf4 and PTEN on SMC reprogramming and identify essential endogenous pathways involved in SMC reprogramming (Aim Two), and define the in vivo fate and function of SMC-derived VPCs in response to vascular injury (Aim Three).]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic heterogeneity is one of the major reasons for failure to identify genetic associations of complex diseases. Often, patients with complex diseases have various phenotypic characteristics and can be grouped into variable subtypes, possibly reflecting differences in underlying genetic mechanisms. Existing approaches either ignore genetic heterogeneity among patients, or lack parsimony with a large number of degrees of freedom in test statistics. There is a lack of statistical approaches that can efficiently combie association evidence from varied disease subtypes while accounting for genetic heterogeneity. As such, we propose to test genetic association using a novel three-stage polynomial logistic regression model, which takes genetic heterogeneity among disease subtypes into account while reducing large number of parameters for testing genetic association. We plan to apply the proposed approach to a real dataset from a collaboration study with the goal to find genetic associations of structural cardiovascular malformations in 22q11DS children. We expect that the proposed project will yield a new powerful statistical approach and the corresponding software for identifying genetic associations of complex diseases, and has the potential to identify novel genetic variants, genes and pathways, providing an insight into biological mechanisms of congenital heart defects.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

This research proposal encompasses four inter-related projects that seek to do the following. Specific Aims I and II: Delineate mechanisms of, and identify effective therapies for, chronic pain resulting from traumatic nerve injury and limb amputation. Neuromas resulting from traumatic nerve injury and traumatic limb amputation can act as sites of abnormal ectopic impulse generation, which are linked to neuropathic pain. In many cases, neuroma-induced pain is not responsive to existing medications. We have shown that sodium channel Nav1.3 accumulates in both painful human neuromas and in experimental neuromas. The biophysical characteristics of Nav1.3 support its contribution to ectopic impulse generation in neuromas. In translational Aim I, we will build upon our viral- mediated shRNA (AAV-shRNA) knockdown of Nav1.3 in rat DRG in vivo and test the hypothesis that AAV- shRNA-Nav1.3 attenuates neuroma-induced pain. Multiple studies have indicated a contribution of channel isoform Nav1.7 to neuropathic pain. Nav1.7 accumulates in injured axon tips within human neuromas and in experimental neuromas, and has been genetically linked to human pain. As an alternative to targeting Nav1.3, Aim II will test AAV-shRNA mediated knockdown of Nav1.7 toward attenuation of neuroma-induced pain. Specific Aim III: Decipher specific sodium channel isoforms responsible for action potential conduction along nociceptive nerve fibers. In this mechanistic aim, we will assess the contribution of Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.3 to electrogenesis in small-diameter axons of DRG neurons. We have recently developed the capability to patch-clamp small diameter (<1mm) DRG neurites in vitro and demonstrated that TTX-S and TTX-R sodium conductances are sequentially activated during action potentials. To advance our understanding of axonal electrogenesis, a logical next step is to identify the underlying channel subtypes and assess their contribution to excitability in nociceptive axons, as we propose in this specific aim.
In addition, we will assess the functional effect of gain- of-function variants of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 that are known to be associated with chronic pain syndromes in humans, on electrogenesis within the axonal compartment, utilizing our DRG culture/patch-clamp system. Specific Aim IV: Determine the contribution of aberrant sodium channel expression in SCI-induced spasticity. Spasticity after SCI has been classically thought to be a result of enhanced synaptic transmission along the spinal reflex pathways as well as loss of inhibition. However, studies at the circuit level, and computer simulation studies, suggest a contribution of increased intrinsic excitability of motor neurons and altered expression of sodium channels within motor neurons to spasticity after SCI. We have demonstrated upregulated expression of Nav1.3 within dorsal horn neurons after SCI and several investigators have reported upregulated expression of sodium channels in spinal and facial motor neurons following peripheral axotomy. Additionally, we have shown that Nav1.8 is mis-expressed in human CNS neurons, cerebellar Purkinje neurons) in patients with multiple sclerosis and in mice with EAE. In this mechanistic/translational aim, we will use molecular, patch-clamp, and knockdown methods to test the hypothesis that dysregulated sodium channel expression in motor neurons contributes to spasticity following SCI, and will determine whether knockdown of such dysregulated channels ameliorates spasticity.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human tumorigenic retrovirus that infects approximately 15-25 million people worldwide. A small portion of infected individuals fall victim to a fatal, highly chemotherapy resistant disease of CD4+ T-lymphocytes known as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Evidence suggests that ATL arises from a multitude of factors that include both genetic and epigenetic changes in the cell that accumulate over time. While many aspects of HTLV-1 biology have been revealed, the detailed mechanism(s) of ATL development remain poorly defined. Recently, our research team has identified PRMT5 over-expression to be relevant to the pathogenesis of both hematologic and solid tumors, and to play an essential role during B-cell transformation by the tumorigenic herpesvirus Epstein-Barr. PRMT5 is an epigenetic modifier that silences the transcription of many key regulatory cellular genes through symmetric di-methylation (S2Me) of arginine (R) residues on histone proteins (H4R3 & H3R8). We seek to test the hypothesis that PRMT5 contributes to HTLV-1-driven cellular transformation and leukemia, and ultimately determine the efficacy of PRMT5 inhibitors (PRMT5i) in a preclinical ATL mouse model. Specifically, we will determine 1) the expression pattern of PRMT5 protein and RNA during HTLV-1-mediated T-cell transformation using in vitro co-culture transformation assays, 2) the role of PRMT5 in host and viral gene expression using novel PRMT5i and shRNAs in tissue culture cell lines, and 3) the therapeutic effects of PRMT5i in an in vivo ATL mouse model by examining viral replication kinetics, tumor size, and survival. This R21 is a necessary first step to identify PRMT5 as an important epigenetic factor during HTLV-1-mediated cellular transformation and pathogenesis, and will ultimately provide important insight towards its potential as an ATL therapy target.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are common, familial vascular malformations that arise due to mutations in three genes, KRIT1, CCM2 and PDCD10. Adaptor proteins encoded by the CCM genes bind each other and the cell surface receptor, Heart of Glass (HEG). Genetic studies in mice have revealed that HEG-CCM signaling is required in endothelial cells for early vascular development, while dilated hearts in deficient fish have also suggested that CCM signaling guides heart development and growth. How CCM signaling alters endothelial cell function in the setting of cardiovascular development and CCM disease remains unclear. We have used a new Nfatc1Cre allele to delete CCM signaling exclusively in the endocardium of the heart, thereby bypassing the requirement for this pathway in early vessel growth. We find that endocardial loss of CCM signaling results in heart failure associated with loss of cardiac jelly and over-expression of the ADAMTS5 protease and the KLF2 transcription factor. Reduced expression of either gene rescues the heart defects in ccm-deficient fish, demonstrating causal, functional roles for these new downstream CCM signaling effectors. The present proposal will define this new pathway downstream of CCM signaling by (i) testing CCM regulation of cardiac and vascular matrix, (ii) defining the role of CCM regulation of KLF2 in cardiac development and vascular disease models, and (iii) testing the hypothesis that CCM signaling affects matrix and KLF2 and ADAMTS5 gene expression through regulation of MEKK3 activity and MAPK signaling. These studies are expected to yield new insight into how the endocardium regulates cardiac development, and how CCM signaling affects endothelial cell function in the context of cardiovascular development and vascular disease.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a food-borne facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that has been responsible for some of the deadliest contaminated food outbreaks in U.S. history. While disease in healthy individuals is usually limited to gastroenteritis, serious invasive disease occurs in susceptible populations that include
immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, neonates, and the elderly. Lm infections are commonly associated with meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscesses, cardiac infections, septicemia, or stillbirth and abortion in pregnant women. Invasive disease resulting from Lm infection has a mortality rate that ranges from approximately 20% to up to 66% or higher despite antibiotic treatment, and surviving individuals often suffer from debilitating neurological sequelae. New effective strategies for successful treatment of Lm invasive infections are urgently needed to limit the severity of disease and the serious post-infection sequelae. In addition, a broader understanding of the molecular adaptations that enable Lm to transition from soil saprophyte to pathogen may facilitate better assessment of environmental reservoirs of disease. The focus of this proposal is on deciphering how a novel bacterial peptide pheromone-based signaling system enables a soil bacterium to transition into life within the mammalian cytosol. Central to the Lm soil-to-cytosol transition is the ability of the bacterium to sense its location within the vacuoles of infected host cells and express gene products that promote vacuole lysis and bacterial escape into the cytosol where replication occurs. We have identified a bacterial peptide pheromone that enhances Lm escape from host vacuoles and which is required for bacterial virulence in animals. The working hypothesis of this R21 proposal is that the pPplA peptide pheromone enables Lm to sense the spatial confines of the vacuole and induce the expression of gene products necessary for vacuole escape and cytosolic replication. This proposal will use a combination of genetic, biochemical, and in vivo approaches to functionally decipher the contributions of the pPplA peptide pheromone to bacterial virulence. Aim 1 will define the expression patterns and components of the pPplA signaling pathway, and Aim 2 will determine the mechanism by which pPplA enhances bacterial escape from host vacuoles. The ultimate goal of this proposal will be to elucidate the molecular pathways that promote Lm survival within host cells and the transformation of a soil dweller into a cell invader.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is by far the most important helminth parasitic disease of humans. Vaccines are unavailable, the only effective treatment involves repeated dosing with a single drug (praziquantel), and now drug resistance is a concern. Schistosomes are transmitted by aquatic snails. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which snails and schistosomes interact is key for new strategies to interrupt transmission. To this end, the genome of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata was recently sequenced. However, because >50% of the 0.9 Gb genome is highly repetitive, it remains very poorly assembled. It consists of >500,000 contigs, with half the genome contained on contigs under 43 kb (N50 = about the size of a gene). As a result, any genetic markers that associate with parasite immunity are unlikely to be found on the same contig as the causal gene to which they are linked. Six markers linked to schistosome resistance are known in B. glabrata. But most of the genes linked to those markers remain a mystery owing to the inadequate genome assembly. Thus, one of the most important goals of the Biomphalaria research community, to find genes associated with immunity, is currently severely hampered. Fortunately, there is an alternative to complete genome assembly. The repetitive portion of the genome is of little epidemiological importance because we expect it to contain few functional elements or useful genetic markers. The non-repetitive regions of the genome, which include the vast majority of genes, can be assembled with a high-density linkage map via the powerful new method of targeted sequence capture. We are uniquely poised to develop this map, given our preliminary work with linkage mapping in B. glabrata and our past success with high-density targeted capture in other systems. The specific objectives of this application are (1) to generate a high-density linkage map of the non-repetitive
fraction of the B. glabrata genome, and then (2) use that map to identify genes surrounding resistance markers. This map will employ ~40,000 genetic markers to unite >99% of the unique genomic sequence, including >95% of genes, into large linkage groups corresponding to the 18 snail chromosomes. Innovation: Targeted capture is a new approach that has never been used with Biomphalaria. Focusing on just the single-copy, gene-containing fraction of the genome sidesteps the challenge of assembling such a repetitive genome, while creating a high-quality genomic resource for trait mapping. This approach should also be a model for other poorly-assembled genomes. Significance: The snail genome project has thus far failed to facilitate trait mapping as expected. This linkage map will remove the last barrier to rapidly identifying genes that control snail immunity and other phenotypic traits. Understanding snail immunity will reveal new ways to potentially interfere with the parasite (e.g. therapeutics targeting parasite molecules that are targeted by the snail immune system) or to manipulate snail populations to make them into less competent hosts.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that up to 20% of American adults suffer from sleep apnea with an increased risk of developing hypertension and vascular dysfunction. We have observed that simulating sleep apnea in rats by exposing them to intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep also increases blood pressure, augments constrictor sensitivity and impairs endothelial dilation. These vascular changes appear to be due in part to loss of the synthesis of the vasodilator, hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Proposed studies will evaluate the mechanisms of H2S- induced vasodilation and determine how IH exposure impairs H2S signaling to impair vasodilation. H2S is a recently described vasodilator produced in the vasculature by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). H2S hyperpolarizes and relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) but much is still unknown about where, when and how it acts. Genetic deletion of CSE in mice elevates blood pressure and impairs endothelium- dependent dilation supporting its role as an important regulator of the vasculature. Our recent studies reveal that H2S causes vasodilation by activating large-conductance calcium-sensitive potassium channels (BKCa) in endothelial cells, eBK. This autocrine effect of H2S has not previously been investigated and is the focus of this proposal. CSE expression in EC is regulated by the transcription factor, NFATc3 and our data suggest IH decreases NFATc3 activation in EC leading to decreased CSE expression and impaired H2S- induced dilation. Our long term goal is to define H2S signaling in the vascular wall, to understand its regulation during
intermittent hypoxia and to clarify its role in normal and pathological vascular function. The guiding hypothesis for the proposed studies that H2S activates eBK to mediate dilation and that IH disrupts this pathway by decreasing CSE expression. The first Aim of the project is to evaluate H2S activation of K+ channels in endothelial cells. The second Aim is to define the mechanism IH-induced decreases in CSE-dependent vasodilation expression. The third Aim is to Evaluate H2S regulation of blood flow in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds determine how IH alters the regulation to contribute to elevated blood pressure. Together the proposed studies will define H2S signaling at molecular, tissue and whole animal levels to increase our understanding of how H2S contributes to cardiovascular control. Defining the causes of dysregulated H2S signaling in IH-exposed rats will also provide a rational basis for the future development of therapies targeting to effectively treat hypertension and peripheral vascular disease in the sleep apnea population.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity-associated asthma is a distinct entity characterized by increased lower airway obstruction and suboptimal response to conventional asthma management that disproportionately affects urban children. However, its pathogenesis is poorly understood. In contrast to atopic T helper (Th) type 2 inflammation found in classic childhood asthma, studies from our lab indicate that obesity-associated asthma in Hispanic and African American children is associated with non-atopic Th1 inflammation that correlates with lower airway obstruction. Additionally, our findings of decreased promoter methylation of genes associated with T cell signaling suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may, in part, mediate the distinct asthma phenotype observed in obese children. However, molecular mechanisms that underlie non-atopic inflammation in obese asthmatics are not known.  Asthma and obesity are multifactorial diseases, determined by genetic susceptibility, including that related to ancestry, epigenetic modification by environmental exposures and non-genetic environmental factors that influence gene expression and thus clinical phenotype. Hence, investigation of the association between gene expression, genetic polymorphisms, and epigenetic modulation may identify a unifying molecular mechanism to explain the obese asthma phenotype observed in urban children. Situated in the Bronx where the prevalence of childhood asthma and obesity are twice the national average, we are uniquely positioned to study these associations and investigate the role of the genome and epigenome in mediating the effect of obesity on the asthma phenotype. We hypothesize that Th-cell gene expression in obese asthmatics differs from that in normal-weight asthmatics, is determined by genetic polymorphisms (eQTLs and ancestry-specific haplotypes), and is influenced by DNA methylation. We propose the following specific aims to address these hypotheses: (1) To quantify Th-cell gene expression differences between obese asthmatic and normal- weight asthmatic children. (2) To determine if epigenetic mechanisms mediate the effect of obesity on asthma. (3) To investigate if genetic polymorphisms, including ancestry-specific haplotypes, determine susceptibility to obesity-associated asthma. We will isolate Th cells from 100 obese asthmatic and 100 normal-weight asthmatic children matched for age and gender. We will simultaneously conduct genome-wide assays of a) gene expression by Directional Transcriptome Sequencing (RNA-seq) b) DNA methylation by HELP-tagging and c) genetic polymorphisms and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) informative of ancestry by array-based genotyping on these cells.  Study of gene expression and DNA methylation will identify mechanistic molecular pathways specific to the obese asthma phenotype and improve our understanding of the disease pathogenesis. We will identify key molecules associated with non-atopic inflammation that could be novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Links between expression and methylation will elucidate the role of environmental exposures. Association of gene expression with genetic polymorphisms will identify variants predicting genetic susceptibility, which may be used to screen at-risk individuals. Together, our study will provide fundamental insights into the pathogenesis of obesity-associated asthma among high-risk ethnicities.  As a pediatric pulmonologist, my goal is to become an independent translational investigator in the field of pediatric asthma with a focus on the pulmonary effects of obesity. My current objective is to obtain the K23 Mentored Patient Oriented-Research Career Development Award that will allow an in-depth study of genetic and epigenetic factors influencing Th cell mediated inflammation in obese asthmatic minority children. Findings from this proposal will lay the foundation for an R01 application, which may focus on a) validation of the key differentially expressed and/or methylated molecules in a separate cohort of children with poorly controlled disease b) confirmation of the role of key molecules in in-vitro cell culture systems with molecule-specific inhibitors and/or methylation modulators c) a prospective investigation into links between obesity onset, rapidity of weight gain, development of asthma and Th cell differentiation, given the young age at which obesity- associated asthma afflicts urban children.!! The combination of my mentoring team including established researchers in the field of epigenomics, obesity-related diseases, T cell biology, asthma and mucosal and systemic immunity, extensive available resources at Einstein, including the Center of Epigenomics, and our patient population provides an ideal environment to conduct this research and achieve my goals. The career development plan proposed in this application incorporates mentorship in translational epigenetic research, coursework in genetics and epigenomics, hand on training in novel methods to investigate gene expression, genotyping and DNA methylation, and participation and presentation at local, regional and national meetings. Together, the research proposed in this K23 award will lay the foundation for my development into an independent investigator in the field of pediatric obesity-associated asthma.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for donor hearts for transplantation far outstrips the supply; however, only one in three available cardiac grafts are used for transplantation. There are many reasons for graft non-use, but previous studies have failed to demonstrate consistent associations between donor characteristics, donor cardiac function, and adverse recipient outcomes. Thus, there is a critical need to standardize how cardiac allografts are evaluated and accepted for transplantation. Our long-term goal is to safely expand the use of available cardiac allografts without adversely affecting transplant recipient outcomes. We propose to carefully characterize the current population of cardiac organ donors, particularly with regards to allograft function; to examine how decisions are made regarding graft acceptance for transplantation; and to systematically evaluate associations between donor characteristics and recipient outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that acceptable allografts for heart transplantation are being unnecessarily discarded, and the establishment of an evidence-based process for cardiac donor evaluation and acceptance will increase graft utilization rates while maintaining excellent clinical outcomes. In response to this need, we propose a collaborative study with seven organ procurement organizations representing geographically diverse regions of the United States, to address the following specific aims: (1) To identify clinical correlates of graft function in potential donors being evaluated for heart transplantation An existing online donor research database will be expanded for standardized collection of data on detailed donor characteristics, especially as pertains to cardiac allograft function. We will perform expert core review of donor echocardiograms, including serial echocardiograms in donors with cardiac allograft dysfunction. Serial electrocardiograms and cardiac biomarkers (Troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide) will also be studied; (2) To prospectively study reasons for cardiac allograft non-utilization for heart transplantation. Real-time data will be collected on specific reasons for allograft non-acceptance for transplantation in order to study graft acceptance practices and variation in graft utilization nationwide; and (3) To prospectively study associations between donor characteristics and recipient outcomes after heart transplantation. Data will be collected on recipient post-transplant length of hospitalization and survival to identify associations between donor predictors and recipient outcomes. This proposal is innovative because it focuses on an entirely different approach to donor-based research, thereby surmounting the limitations of prior investigations. Completion of the proposed study will have a positive impact by defining how to optimize the evaluation and use of available grafts for heart transplantation, thereby safely expanding the donor pool and increasing the number of heart transplants performed nationwide.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

 The foremost objective of the Structural and Functional Visualization Core is to provide state of the art 
imaging services to the IDDRC community, including both conventional and confocal microscopy, whole 
animal MRI acquisition and analysis support. To attain this goal, the core has been redesigned to provide 
comprehensive imaging services for IDDRC researchers working at on any aspect of the genetic and 
environmentally-induced developmental diseases affecting nervous system development and function. The 
research ongoing in the IDDRC spans basic scientists using reductionist approaches to elucidate the 
mechanisms specific to intellectual developmental disabilities (IDDs) to clinicians assessing therapeutic 
interventions for patients. To accommodate all of their imaging requirements, we are now providing access 
to three light microscopy cores, including a microscopy suite dedicated to IDDRC researchers, two MRI 
facilities and the technical support needed to initiate and complete any imaging analysis. Many IDDRC 
researchers have imaging systems within their own laboratories, however they are often insufficient to meet 
their demand and are never comprehensive. Being able to access the IDDRC-supported microscopy cores 
thus both adds capacity and provides technical resources not otherwise available, permitting researchers to 
refocus their studies in novel and innovative directions. 
 A second key objective of the Structural and Functional Visualization Core is to develop new 
technologies for visualizing biological samples and in turn provide them to IDDRC researchers. Here, we 
focus on [1] developing smaller lighter one-photon miniaturized fluorescent microscopes for live imaging 
neural activity in freely moving animals (1-3) and [2] refining the methods for CLARITY, a protocol that 
renders tissue transparent (4, 5), thereby permitting unparalleled visual acuity into the complex circuitry of 
the brain. These techniques offer the promise of a holistic approach to cutting edge imaging, permitting 
IDDRC researchers to translate mechanism into therapy. For example, researchers investigating a specific 
intellectual disorder, such as Dup15q syndrome (see model project), will be able perform MRI on patients to 
identify the affected region of 
the brain, implant miniaturized microscopes in rodent models to perform in vivo i m a g i n g to examine how 
the firing patterns of specific populations of neuron are mechanistically altered by the disease, while 
concomitantly examining putative aberrant circuit formation using light microscopy coupled with CLARITY. 
 Finally, this core also supports the efforts of all the other cores, offering IDDRC researchers the 
ability to both probe molecular and cellular function at any level from the sub-cellular to living animals 
and determine the consequence of therapeutic interventions.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vaccination with MHC-II restricted ApoB100 peptides to prevent atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of large and medium-sized arteries triggered by elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Recent evidence shows that both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to the disease. Using an in vitro screening assay, we found 34 peptides from mouse apolipoprotein (Apo)B100 that bind major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II (I-Ab in Apoe-/- mice) with high affinity and tested 5 of them in vivo. We discovered that vaccination with I-Ab-binding ApoB100 peptides is strongly atheroprotective in the Apoe-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis. The reductions of atherosclerotic lesion size are associated with increased IL-10 expression in the aortas of vaccinated mice. Since we find elevated IL-10 in aortas of vaccinated mice, we hypothesize that immunization with ApoB100 peptides induces IL-10-producing Tregs and/or IL-10-producing macrophages. Specific aim 1 is to test which cell type is responsible for IL-10 production in aortas of vaccinated mice. We have crossed Apoe-/- mice to IL-10 reporter mice to identify the IL-10-producing cells. Cell type-specific IL-10 knockout mice (Il10fl/fl x LysM-Cre or x FoxP3- Cre) will identify the relevance of this proposed mechanism. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that Tregs afford protection from atherosclerosis. Specific aim 2 is to test the role o regulatory T cells (Tregs) in atheroprotection by ApoB100 peptides. We propose to define the antigen-specific CD4 T cells by surface phenotype and cytokine secretion, test their homing to atherosclerotic mouse aortas and study their interaction with dendritic cells (DCs) in atherosclerotic plaque by live cell multiphoton imaging. Based on preliminary data identifying 30 human ApoB100 peptides that bind many alleles of human MHC-II, we propose that ApoB100-based atheroprotective vaccination strategies are translatable to humans. Specific aim 3 is to translate atheroprotective vaccination to humans. We discovered one peptide that is human-to-mouse ApoB100 sequence-identical and binds to many human MHC-II alleles including DRB1*0101. We will test the effect of this sequence-identical ApoB100 peptide on atherosclerosis in existing mice transgenic for DRB1*0101, optimize vaccination regimens (adjuvant, frequency, dose) and evaluate the potential of tetramers and peptide- specific antibodies as biomarkers reporting successful vaccination. When the proposed work is completed, we will know (1) the role of IL-10 in vaccination-induced atheroprotection (2) the role of Tregs in atheroprotection and the mechanism of their homing and maintenance in the aorta and (3) whether this approach is indeed practical and translatable to humans. We already have an in vitro screening assay and propose to develop biomarkers to test for successful vaccination. Ultimately, a safe and effective atherosclerosis vaccine could have a very large national and world-wide public health impact.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[The mission of the Pilot & Feasibility Study (P&F) Program is to provide initial support for new investigators, for 
established investigators to explore new directions, and to enable the Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research 
Center (ES-DRC) to attract scientists from other disciplines to diabetes research. The P&F Program is a vital 
component of the ES-DRC and has successfully promoted numerous new research endeavors in diabetes- 
related areas. This program constitutes a key interface among the Einstein, Mount Sinai and other regional 
academic communities at large, and serves as a major attraction in the recruitment of faculty and staff. Over 
the past 37 years the Center funded 113 feasibility studies from a pool of 449 applications (funding rate of 
25.1%). These studies also include targeted efforts in this project period to increase the number of applications 
funded in our regional center at both the basic, clinical and translational diabetes efforts. We anticipate funding 
7 Pilot & Feasibility grants at steady state, alternating between 4 new awards and 3 continuing awards, each 
year; typically, projects are funded for two years if sufficient progress is shown after the first year. The P&F 
study program has enabled recipients to obtain data and publications that constituted the basis for successful 
applications for extramural support. Under the same administrative umbrella as the Pilot & Feasibility program, 
we established a microgrant award program that provides specific support for the use of ES-DRC Core 
facilities. Last year, the microgrant program funded 8 awards out of 19 submitted applications. In addition, we 
also partner with the Einstein Clinical and Translational Science Award on a catalytic seed grant to support 
diabetes-specific translation research. These value added programs further enhance diabetes directed 
research efforts. To continue these established and new initiatives within the P&F program, we will: 1) 
advertise and organize the yearly P&F grant competition cycle; 2) support mechanisms for interaction and 
collaboration among established researchers in diabetes and related areas and for those who are new to the 
field; 3) provide mentoring and guidance for investigators who are new to diabetes research to facilitate 
generation of preliminary data with the goal of successful applications for NIH funding and other funding 
sources; 4) communicate responsibilities and opportunities to P&F awardees by integrating them into ES-DRC 
activities; 5) provide $10,000 of free use of each ES-DRC Biomedical Core services directly related to the 
funded P&F project; and 6) manage the institutionally microgrant and Catalytic Seed Grant Award programs in 
diabetes and metabolism.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[Using a faith-based and community-based participatory research approach, the OASIS (Obesity and Stress in South Asians) Project seeks to elucidate the clinical, behavioral, social and cultural mechanisms that link acculturation, stress, and obesity in South Asian populations in New York City (NYC) and to explore the potential efficacy of faith-based strategies for health promotion and disease prevention in these communities. The Specific Aims of this five-year study include:To establish an infrastructure for health promotion and disease prevention among faith-based organizations serving Asian American communities in NYC; To translate and adapt and evidence-based faith-based intervention proven effective in other racial and ethnic minority communities for the Asian American community; and To evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the adapted intervention to improve physical activity and reduce the risk for obesity and obesity-related diseases among South Asian communities. We will review faith-based intervention components found to be effective in the African American community and work with religious leaders and community partners to identify those strategies that could be replicated and are deemed acceptable and appropriate within the cultural context of Asian American communities. We will then translate and adapt these components in culturally- and linguistically-appropriate strategies and messages that fit with the goals of the participating religious institutions and for the communities they serve. Critical to the process of meaningful translation and effective adoption of the intervention is the following activities: a) conduct formative research; b) apply a CBPR approach; c) secure faith-based leadership support and guidance in intervention design; d) develop appropriate messaging and educational campaigns; e) support environmental and policy changes; and f) strengthen capacity of religious and community leaders at participating faith-based organizations to fully engage in research, as well as health promotion (including for example, effective messaging and communication). We will be able to identify successful components that can be generalized across different Asian ethnic and religious groups.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Viruses have evolved to infect a host, propagate and be transmitted to another host as efficiently as possible. In contrast, an infected host has evolved to try to survive infection, irrespective of transmission of the virus. Viruses take many different approaches to survival in a host prior to transmission, such as manipulating the host immune response to reduce or prevent recognition or clearance of the virus. The task of the host immune response is to clear the pathogen as quickly as possible to prevent virus-induced disease. However, an over exuberant immune response can cause immunopathology, potentially leading to death of the host, an evolutionary dead end. Therefore it is the aim of both
the virus (to allow sufficient opportunity for transmission) and the host (to prevent immunopathology) to moderate the immune response and often virus and host use similar approaches to achieve this goal. In this proposal we will examine the role of pro-resolving lipids that are products of 15-lipoxygenase action of omega-3 fatty acids, and which have a profound anti-inflammatory action. We have made the unprecedented finding that mice lacking 15-lipoxygenase are susceptible to lethal challenge with ectromelia virus, a poxvirus that is a natural pathogen of mice and is the cause of mousepox. Poxviruses are a unique family of viruses that, despite the eradication of smallpox, constitute an ever- increasing risk of human infection worldwide via the action of monkeypoxvirus, camelpox and buffalopox transmission to humans. Therefore these studies have broad implications for human health, both for these infections, for the design of effective viral vacine vectors, and for lipid moderation of virus infections as a whole. Poxviruses are also known to encode many modulatory proteins that alter immune function, among them the serpin SPI-2, that has been shown to alter production of lipids in infected cells. In Aim 1 we will examine the changes in the production of pro-resolving lipids is changed by ectromelia infection, both in vitro in different cell types and in vivo over te course of infection. In addition, we will examine the effect of the immunomodulatory protein SPI-2 upon the changes observed in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2 we will examine the changes in the innate and adaptive immune response to ECTV in the absence of 15-lipoxygenase, and how this is changed by the action of SPI-2. We expect the results produced to be a comprehensive characterization of how poxvirus infection changes the production of pro-resolving lipids both in vitro and in vivo. We anticipate that the results gained from these studies will form the basis of  future RO1 or PO1 proposal in which the mechanisms by which pro-resolving lipids confer survival from lethal viral challenge are examined.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular imaging with targeted imaging probes can be used to evaluate vascular phenotype in cardiovascular disease. In the past funding period, we developed new tools for assessing endothelial activation and cellular adhesion using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) molecular imaging in order to detect and quantify high risk atherosclerotic disease. Because CEU molecular imaging can detect events that occur at the endothelial-blood pool interface with high sensitivity and temporal resolution, it is a potentially
valuable asset in preclinical research than can be used to discover new disease-related pathways or to rapidly test new candidate therapies. The overall aim of this proposal is to leverage the technologies we have developed in order to better understand the role of platelets throughout the course of atherosclerotic plaque development. Platelet-endothelial interactions have been postulated to play an important early role in promoting atherosclerosis by potentiating the inflammatory response. These interactions have not been well characterized because of lack of appropriate tools for assessing platelet- endothelial interactions in vivo. In Aim 1 CEU molecular imaging of platelet GPIb? and endothelial activation in a murine model of atherosclerosis will be used to temporally characterize platelet-endothelial interaction and endothelial inflammatory activation at different stages of plaque development. Mechanism for platelet adhesion will also be investigated by: (a) imaging the effects of inhibitors to the molecular pathways that may mediate platelet-endothelial or platelet-monocyte complexes, and (b) direct molecular imaging of potential mediators such as dysregulated von Willebrand factor. Since increased oxidative stress is a likely common mediator of endothelial activation and platelet adhesion, in Aim 2, we will determine whether platelet-endothelial interactions at various
stages of atherosclerosis are modifiable by potent anti-oxidant therapies (NADPH-oxidase inhibitors, catalase mimetics, or stable transfection with single chain antibodies against oxidized
lipoproteins). CEU molecular imaging will be an important biologic readout for these studies. In Aim 3, we will evaluate endothelial-platelet interactions and endothelial inflammatory activation in primates by studying obese, insulin- resistant, and atherosclerotic rhesus macaques. In these studies CEU molecular imaging will be combined with targeted radionuclide imaging of vascular lipid oxidation. Treatment effects of NADPH oxidase inhibitors will again be used to determine the regulatory role of oxidative stress. Successful completion of these studies will provide important new information on atherosclerosis pathophysiology which can be targeted for therapy.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increased levels of misfolded proteins in the heart are associated with a large subset of congestive heart failure (CHF), the final common pathway for virtually all heart diseases and afflicting the life of millions of Americans. Targeted removal of most cellular proteins is primarily done by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) which degrades a protein via two steps: (1) attachment of a chain of ubiquitin (Ub) to a target protein molecule via a process known as ubiquitination; (2) degradation of the ubiquitinated protein by the proteasome. Cardiac UPS dysfunction is associated with CHF of common causes and a frequently indicated defect is an uncoupling between the two steps, as suggested by the paradoxical co-existence of increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins with elevated or normal proteasomal peptidase activities in diseased myocardium. However, little is known about the molecular basis and pathophysiological significance of the uncoupling. The UBL-UBA family of Ub receptors (Ubiquilin1, Rad23, Ddi1) are purport to recruit ubiquitinated proteins for the proteasome, thereby promoting the coupling. To date, the role of none of these Ub receptors in mammalian hearts is elucidated. Our pilot studies reveal that cardiac Ubqln1 proteins were remarkably increased in human end-stage CHF from ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy and in mouse models of desmin-related cardiomyopathy (DRC), a bona fide cardiomyopathy caused by increased expression of misfolded proteins. Our preliminary data also suggest that Ubqln1 promotes proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins without altering proteasome activities. Hence, we hypothesize that Ubqln1 up-regulation protects against proteotoxicity in cardiomyocytes by enhancing the recruitment of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins to the proteasome for degradation. A unique set of genetically altered mice as well as human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes will be used to interrogate Ubqln1 and proteasome functions in cardiomyocytes to investigate the role of Ubqln1 in the DRC progression, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and post I/R cardiac remodeling in mice and to test the hypothesis that Ubqln1 functions as a shuttling Ub receptor to recruit ubiquitinated misfolded proteins to the proteasome for degradation, thereby protecting against proteotoxicity in cardiomyocytes. The completion of this work is expected to improve our understanding of cardiac protein quality control and provide new molecular targets for developing new strategies to fight cardiac disease with increased proteotoxicity, an increasingly suggested major pathogenic factor of CHF.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the mechanisms and electrophysiological consequences of the molecular interactions between the inward rectifier potassium channel protein Kir2.1 and the ?ubunit of the major cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5. Our preliminary results strongly suggest that NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 modulate each other's surface expression and function through their respective PDZ binding domains within a macromolecular complex to control cardiac excitability. Such a dynamic reciprocity is post-translational, involving, at least in part, mutual regulation of trafficking and targeting of both channel proteins at common membrane compartments, as well as internalization. We focus on inheritable mutations that are known to disrupt trafficking of NaV1.5 (Brugada Syndrome, BS) or Kir2.1 (Andersen-Tawil Syndrome, ATS). We surmise that a mutation that disrupts the expression of one channel protein type (e.g., NaV1.5) will also affect the other type (e.g., Kir2.1 by disturbing the common macromolecular complex through which they interact, thus contributing to both the electrophysiological phenotype and arrhythmogenic potential. We will test the following three major hypotheses: 1) NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 protein channels undergo PDZ-domain mediated interactions with common partners in a macromolecular complex that controls their membrane stability; 2) macromolecular complex formation affects anterograde and/or retrograde trafficking of Kir2.1 and NaV1.5; and 3) human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CMs) expressing either ATS or BS mutations that affect protein trafficking will show reduced excitability reflecting altered expression of both channel proteins, which should contribute strongly to the inherited arrhythmia phenotype. We propose to combine proteomics (e.g., protein purification, yeast two-hybrid assay and interaction domain mapping) and genetic (e.g., mutagenesis and silencing) tools, confocal microscopy, live cell imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, patch clamping, optical mapping, gene transfer and silencing in heterologous systems, and in single, highly mature ventricular-like hiPSC-CMs and hiPSC-CM monolayers. We will also conduct computer simulations to enable the virtual dissection and interpretation of the electrophysiological and arrhythmogenic changes resulting from NaV1.5-Kir2.1 interactions and their mutants in a macromolecular complex.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to apply new methods of analysis to improve the utility of attitudinal data in predicting fertility-related behaviors. Demographers have struggled for decades with the difficulty of predicting fertility at the individual level using attitudinal measures. A key question is to what extent weak associations between attitudes and behavior result from a true disjuncture between cognition (what people think) and behavior (what they do), and to what extent they are an artifact of inadequate measurement of cognition. Our project focuses on the second possibility. In this project, we use an innovative conceptualization of fertility-related attitudes that draws on advances in psychology regarding cognition and behavior. Specifically, we take attitude measures as meaningful in relation to other attitude measures, and we consider patterns of relationships between attitude measures as a proxy for patterns of cognitive associations. The specific aims of the proposed research are (1) to use novel methods for analyzing fertility-related attitudinal data to group respondents who think similarly about fertility, and to describe the patterns of cognitive associations and sociodemographic characteristics of the groups identified; and (2) to determine whether these methods predict behavioral outcomes (in this case, contraceptive use) better than do conventional methods of analyzing attitude data. This project addresses recent calls by prominent demographers to use models of cognitive processes and demographic behavior that reflect advances in scientific knowledge about cognition and behavior (e.g., Bachrach 2014; Bachrach and Morgan 2013; Johnson-Hanks et al. 2011). Our analyses will use the rich data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life study, a longitudinal survey of a population-based sample of young women. The data contain multiple measures of attitudes in many domains related to fertility behavior, including attitudes about motherhood, relationship sequences, contraception, timing of childbearing, career, and education. The data also include detailed measures of contraceptive use, allowing us to relate attitude structures to behavioral outcomes. We will use two types of methods, Latent Class Analysis (LCA), a measure that creates latent groups based on sharing similar patterns of responses across a series of variables, and Relational Class Analysis (RCA), which identifies subgroups of respondents who share similar relationships among their responses. These methods allow us to distinguish among respondents who give the same answers to some items but who think about fertility in fundamentally different ways. This research will test theories regarding the role of attitudes in fertility behavior and provide replicable procedures for analyzing the predictive value of survey-based measures of attitudes.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significant burden that results from dengue virus infection combined with the absence of effective vaccines or drugs makes the development of novel therapeutics a high priority. We have previously identified disubstituted pyrimidines that inhibit dengue virus entry by binding to the pre-fusion E dimer on the virion surface, perhaps in the beta-octoglucoside binding pocket previously identified by Harrison and colleagues. Here, we propose to develop assays to identify other ligands of this site that can inhibit dengue virus entry. The subsequent high-throughput screening (HTS) effort and downstream activities are needed to interrogate the chemical diversity that can bind in this pocket, to generate additional lead compounds, and to elucidate the structural and mechanistic correlates of potent anti-dengue activity. In Aim 1, we will use these compounds to develop a high-throughput fluorescence polarization assay to identify ligands of the dengue virus envelope protein that inhibit dengue virus infection. In Aim 2, we propose to develop an assay to monitor bulk fusion of viral particles in vitro. In Aim 3, we will validate our assay pipeline by performing a pilot screen. We will use assays developed in Aims 1 and 2 as well as other assays previously developed in our laboratory to characterize the mechanisms of action of compounds with activity against dengue virus. At the conclusion of this proposal, we anticipate having robust assays that are ready for high-throughput screening. The goal of these downstream HTS efforts is the development of molecular probes to study the structural and biochemical mechanisms of dengue entry, to validate the beta-octoglucoside pocket as a molecular target for inhibition of dengue entry, and to define the SAR governing the anti-dengue activity of ligands of the beta-octoglucoside pocket. In the longer term, this work will also contribute to our future goals of developing small molecule inhibitors of DV entry as preclinical candidates for anti-dengue drug discovery efforts.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social communication is at the heart of successful, healthy social interactions in humans. Social communication deficits are characteristic of several mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Dysfunction in reward neural systems, including opioid neural systems, has been pro- posed to contribute to social communication deficits characteristic of these disorders, yet little research has focused on the role of reward neural systems in social communication. Furthermore, it is not clear why communication deficits associated with these disorders are observed in some but not other social contexts. One possibility supported by pilot data in a songbird model system is that communication in distinct social contexts is rewarded by distinct mechanisms. The long-term goal of the principal investigator is to identify the neurochemical mechanisms responsible for communication produced in distinct social contexts. The objective of this application is to identif the role of reward and opioid neuropeptides in the medial preoptic nucleus (mPOA) in communication in distinct social contexts. The mPOA regulates affiliative social behavior and communication, and opioid release in mPOA induces reward. In a songbird model, sexually-motivated communication (SMC) can result in immediate external reward (e.g., courtship song results in copulation). In contrast, general social communication (GSC) occurs in social groups in a non-sexual, affiliative context and does not result in immediate overt reward (e.g., copulation), suggesting GSC is linked to intrinsic reward. The central hypothesis sup- ported by strong preliminary data is that GSC is stimulated and maintained by an individual's intrinsic reward state induced by opioid release in mPOA. In contrast, SMC may be reinforced primarily by conspecific responses to song. Four specific aims based on strong pilot data in a songbird model system are proposed 1) to determine the extent to which opioid markers in mPOA relate to individual differences in GSC and SMC using Western immunoblots and quantitative real time PCR in starlings singing in distinct social contexts; 2) to determine the extent to which opioid markers in mPOA relate to intrinsic reward associated with GSC and SMC using conditioned place preference, a standard measure of reward; 3) to determine the extent to which opioids stimulate GSC and SMC using site-specific opioid pharmacological manipulations in mPOA; 4) to determine the extent to which opioid antagonists disrupt the link between reward and GSC by examining effects of opioid pharmacological manipulations in mPOA on song-associated reward measured using conditioned place preference. Results will elucidate links between opioids, reward, and communication produced within distinct social contexts. The research is innovative and significant because it will provide novel insight into neural mechanisms underlying the motivation to communicate and ways in which distinct reward mechanisms function to shape socially-appropriate behavioral interactions. Findings will reveal mechanisms that facilitate communication in select social contexts.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this application is to develop much needed and easy to use optical and genetic tools to permit the study of astrocyte function in physiological compartments for genetically specified and tractable cell populations. Astrocytes interact with neurons via fine specialised distal extensions called peripheral astrocyte processes (PAPs). However, a bottleneck to progress has been lack of methods to monitor calcium signals in PAPs, which is a crucial hurdle to overcome in order to understand diverse astrocyte functions in different parts of the brain. This application is based on advances made in our laboratory that allow us to directly measure calcium signals in PAPs. To develop such a method we modified a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) called GCaMP2 to carry a membrane tethering domain (Lck), thus generating Lck-GCaMP2. Then we improved this ~3-fold to generate Lck-GCaMP3 and expressed this in vivo with adeno associated viruses (AAV). Our recent unpublished findings show that Lck-GCaMP3 allows for non-invasive imaging with spectacular clarity. This is a very exciting innovative breakthrough that for the first time will alow researchers to directly measure physiologically relevant astrocyte signals and functions. Moreover, with recent structure-based refinements we made Lck-GCaMP5G, which is ~3-fold better than Lck-GCaMP3 and ~10-fold better than Lck-GCaMP2. We are now ready to develop novel in vivo tools so that Lck-GCaMP5G can be used by anyone and thus generalise a precise way to study astrocyte function and diversity. In Aim 1 we will generate knock-in mice expressing Lck-GCaMP5G at the Rosa26 locus. In Aim 2 we will generate novel BAC transgenic mice expressing Cre/ERT in genetically specified astrocytes. In Aim 3 we will exploit our novel mice to image astrocyte calcium signals in thalamocortical slices.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes remains a major risk factor for the development of both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, despite improvements in clinical treatments, our knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of diabetes-associated CVD is poorly understood. As with the majority of cardiovascular physiology, pathologic cardiovascular events exhibit a time-of-day-dependence, with regards to both onset and impact on disease progression and we have shown that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock directly influences the manner with which the heart responds to specific stressors. Importantly, we have shown that diabetes induces a phase shift in the cardiomyocyte circadian clock. Thus dysynchrony of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock may be an important and previously unrecognized contributor to the etiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Protein O-GlcNAcylation, a metabolically regulated post-translational modification that rapidly influences protein function, is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of both cardiac physiology and pathology including the adverse effects of diabetes. We recently reported that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock directly influences cardiac O-GlcNAc levels, that at least two circadian clock components are O-GlcNAc modified, and those acute increases in O-GlcNAc levels phase shifts the clock similarly to that seen in the heart during diabetes. We have also observed increased protein synthesis in the heart during the inactive phase, a time when protein O-GlcNAcylation is low. This has led us to postulate that protein O- GlcNAcylation may be a key mechanism by which the cardiomyocyte circadian clock temporally coordinates repair/replacement of damaged proteins in the heart. Collectively, these observations support the overall hypothesis of this proposal that dysregulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation is a critical
factor contributing to diabetes-induced alterations of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock, and that misalignment of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock represents a key mechanism underlying diabetes-related cardiac dysfunction. To test this hypothesis we will pursue 3 specific aims: 1) Determine the molecular underpinnings linking the cardiomyocyte circadian clock with protein O-GlcNAcylation, and identify how this relationship is altered during diabetes; 2) Determine the role of O-GlcNAcylation in circadian clock mediated protein turnover, and elucidate how this relationship is modified during diabetes; 3) Determine whether re-alignment of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock during diabetes attenuates cardiomyopathy development. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to new fundamental insights regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of aberrant circadian function in the development of diabetes-related cardiac disease and will help identify new approaches for reducing the risk of CVD in diabetic patients.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microvascular disease associated with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease is becoming increasingly common in the aging population of the Western world. Remodeling and loss of micro vessels (MV) distal to renal arterial obstruction leads to irreversible injury, which is magnified by coexistence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, no effective clinically applicable strategies are currently available that are capable of improving MV structure and function and restoring renal viability. Low-energy shock wave therapy (SWT) is a novel non-invasive experimental strategy, which elicits biological responses in the cardiovascular system, including stimulation of endogenous reparative capacity and formation of new MV. In rodent models SWT can enhance recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to sites of hind-limb ischemia. Yet, the potential of this novel therapeutic platform t improve MV viability in renovascular diseased (RVD) associated with MetS has not been investigated. We have developed and characterized novel swine models of RVD and MetS that allow translational studies highly relevant to clinical medicine, as well as unique imaging techniques ideally suited for probing MV injury and viability. We have also shown the efficacy of using autologous EPC delivered into a stenotic renal artery to improve distal function. These tools now afford an opportunity to test the ability of SWT to enhance renal MV function and structure in RVD and promote recruitment of EPC to improve MV regeneration. The working hypothesis underlying this proposal is that SWT in RVD/MetS decreases injury, improves MV viability, and promotes recruitment of circulating EPC in the post-stenotic kidney. To test this hypothesis, we will study the effects of SWT using cutting-edge multi-detector CT (MDCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and micro-CT tools. Furthermore, the ability of SWT to improve renal recovery prospects will be tested in PVD pigs undergoing revascularization and stenting. Three specific aims will be pursued: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that SWT activates mechano- transduction signaling and improves renal MV density and function in RVD associated with MetS. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that this tactic would boost kidney MV viability after revascularization of RVD/MetS. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that SWT promotes recruitment and local retention of endogenous and exogenous EPC, respectively, in the post-stenotic kidney. Noninvasive improvement of the MV network using SWT is a promising, cutting edge technique, which will likely contribute significantly towards management of MV disease. The proposed studies may have broad ramifications and establish this novel, clinically feasible therapeutic strategy for RVD, MetS, and hypertension.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The highly polymorphic killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their HLA class I ligands play a central role in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cells, and in the ability of HIV-1 infected individuals to control virus replication. However, functional studies to address the significance of KIR-MHC class I interactions in immunodeficiency virus infection have been limited by the lack of defined MHC class I ligands for KIRs in non-human primate models. We recently identified Mamu-A*02, an MHC class I molecule present in approximately 20% of Indian origin rhesus macaques, as a ligand for Mamu-KIR3DL05 (3DL05). This interaction was peptide-dependent, since Mamu-A*02 tetramers folded with certain simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides, but not others, stained primary NK cells and transfected cells expressing multiple 3DL05 alleles. Consistent with the function of an inhibitory KIR, target cells expressing Mamu-A*02 (A*02) suppressed the degranulation of tetramer-positive NK cells from 3DL05+ macaques. These observations suggest that SIV, and potentially also HIV-1, may acquire changes in epitopes that increase the avidity of MHC class I ligands for inhibitory KIRs as a mechanism of immune evasion to prevent the activation of specific NK cell subsets. Using KIR- and MHC class I-defined rhesus macaques, we will specifically address this hypothesis, as well as other questions fundamental to the biology of NK cells in immunodeficiency virus infection.    
The first objective of this proposal (Aim 1) is to identify additional MHC class I ligands for Mamu
KIR3DL01 and -KIR3DL05; two KIRs that are commonly expressed in the rhesus macaque and for which we have identified reagents for staining these receptors on primary NK cells. This aim will build on recent work by our group to provide a broader foundation for investigating the role of KIR-MHC class I interactions in SIV infection. Our second objective (Aim 2) is to address the functional implications of viral peptides that modulate NK cell activation. We will determine the repertoire of SIV peptides that enhance or antagonize interactions with 3DL05, and will test the hypothesis that viral epitopes, which stabilize interactions with inhibitory KIRs, facilitate virus
replication in the presence of NK cells bearing these receptors. Our third objective (Aim 3) is to compare longitudinal changes in 3DL05+ NK cells following SIV infection of 3DL05+/A*02+ versus 3DL05+/A*02- animals. The following questions will be addressed; Does the recognition of A*02-bound peptides stimulate or suppress the expansion of 3DL05+ NK cells? Are there phenotypic/functional differences in 3DL05+ NK cells in A*02+ versus A*02- animals? Is there a difference in the recruitment of 3DL05+ NK cells to tissues? These unprecedented studies will provide a better understanding of the importance of KIR-MHC class I interactions in immunodeficiency virus infection, and specifically the role of viral peptides in modulating NK cell
activation as a mechanism of immune evasion.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2) plays a major role in lipid degradation and is believed to underlie drug-induced phospholipidosis, which commonly occurs in patients taking cationic lipophilic drugs such as the antiarrhythmic amiodarone. Aberrant LPLA2 activity may also be involved in development of autoimmune disease and atherosclerosis. LPLA2 is 50% identical in sequence to lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a key enzyme in reverse cholesterol transport from arterial plaque macrophages via high density lipoproteins (HDL). Genetic mutations in LCAT are responsible for Familial LCAT Deficiency (FLD), a devastating disease characterized by low serum cholesterol ester levels and renal failure. There are no reported atomic models for either LPLA2 or LCAT, which do not have significant homology to other proteins of known structure. Thus, the molecular bases for their substrate selectivity, regulation, and disease phenotypes remain poorly understood. In this proposal, we address this critical gap in knowledge via functional analysis of our new 1.8 ? crystal structure of LPLA2, determination of the atomic structure of LCAT, imaging LCAT bound to HDL particles by electron microscopy, mapping somatic mutations known to cause genetic disease, and investigating the structural basis for differences in acyl acceptor selectivity. In support of our aims, we provide multiple high resolution structure of LPLA2 in various ligand states, negative stained images of LCAT-HDL complexes, and a low resolution crystal structure of fully glycosylated LCAT. The expected outcome of these studies is a better mechanistic understanding of a structurally uncharacterized family of eukaryotic enzymes that play key roles in lipid metabolism. Our structural and functional studies will help explain the molecular basis for genetic disease and ultimately assist in the design of improved biotherapeutics and small molecule LCAT activators to treat lipid-related disorders such as atherosclerosis and LCAT deficiency.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) represents a diverse population of cells responsible for maintaining and regenerating the hematopoietic system. Maintaining the proper function of these cells, and particularly the long-lived self-renewing hematopoietic stem cell, is essential for health and survival. In HIV disease there are serious deficits involving hematopoietic function that cannot simply be explained by HIV-1 infection of T-cells and macrophages. It has been hypothesized that HIV-1 can directly infect HSPC leading to hematopoietic dysfunction. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that HSPC express the receptors necessary for HIV-1 infection and recent studies demonstrating direct infection of HSPC by HIV. It has also been demonstrated that HIV can establish a latent infection in HSPC, suggesting that HSPC could serve as an important reservoir for HIV-1 in drug treated individuals. However, the conclusions of these studies are disputed since they are based principally upon in vitro or ex vivo HIV-1 infection of HSPC. We propose to address the hypothesis that HSPC can be infected and function abrogated by using a model system, the BLT mouse model, which more closely mimics natural HIV-1 infection in the bone marrow (BM).  Investigation of HIV-1 infection of HSPC further requires the recognition that HSPC are not a uniform population. It has been known for decades that the majority of HSPC purified experimentally from bone marrow represent precursor cells that are destined to differentiate to specific lineages. Only a small fraction of these cells represent true hematopoietic stem cells which have the ability to self-renew indefinitely as well as give rise to the committed progenitor cells. In addition, our recent studies of HSPC in non-human primates demonstrate that even long-lived stem cells have different behaviors in regards to their contribution to hematopoietic output and their relative distribution to lymphoid versus myeloid progeny. Thus, it is critical that studies of HIV-1 infection of HSPC should investigate the consequences of infection upon individual HSPC rather than the entire population. This can be accomplished by a method known as clonal tracking, whereby individual HSPC are genetically marked by integrating lentiviral vectors and then tracked after transplant and repopulation. By combining clonal tracking with FACS separation of hematopoietic cell sub-populations, we can investigate the consequences of HIV infection on the behavior of HSPC clones and their progeny. We have used this methodology effectively to study the behavior of HSPC clones in non-human primates and propose to extend this methodology to the impact of HIV-1 infection upon HSPC.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause vasospasm, defects in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cognitive decline. Traumatic SAH is associated with poor outcomes. The underlying causes for these injuries are unknown. Parasympathetic efferents and trigeminal afferents innervating large cerebral vessels as well as intrinsic innervation of cortical vessels may play a role in regulating CBF after injury. The present project focuses on a central neural circuit that has the potential to regulate neurovascular interactions by modulating the perivascular innervation. The objective of the proposed study is to explore a novel hypothesis, namely that the brainstem is an important mediator of cerebral perfusion during SAH. More specifically, an important medullary autonomic and sensorimotor integration center, the rostroventral medial medulla (RVM) modulates cerebral blood flow as part of a coordinated response to SAH aimed at preventing ischemia, and that failure of brainstem compensatory mechanisms contributes to the pathophysiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage. We will test three specific aims. 1. The specific neural pathways through which the RVM modulates CBF (Cetas et al., 2009) are unknown. We will test the role of parasympathetic and sympathetic outflows, interactions with trigeminal sensory pathways, and connections within the central nervous system in the effects of RVM stimulation. 2. The neurons in the RVM are diverse in terms of neurochemistry, physiology, and pharmacology. We will determine which of the physiologically defined RVM cell classes respond to SAH, and test the hypothesis that a class of neurons known to be activated by dural inflammation, ON-cells, are critical for an acute compensatory response that contributes to the restoration of CBF following an experimental SAH. 3. Determine the role of the RVM in delayed cerebral ischemia after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our overarching hypothesis in this Aim is that a failure or reorganization of RVM modulatory mechanisms is important in delayed ischemia following SAH. We will use pharmacological tools to manipulate functionally specific RVM neuronal populations. Effects of RVM manipulation on long-term outcomes will be assessed with quantitative MRI imaging and neurocognitive behavioral studies. This will allow us to test whether distinct neuronal groups in the RVM have an ongoing role in regulation of CBF in the chronic timeframe following experimental SAH. We have adapted a rodent model of SAH in which autologous blood is injected into the prechiasmatic cistern. CBF will be measured using laser Doppler and the powerful optical microangiography (OMAG). MRI will be used to supplement OMAG and correlate changes in CBF with regional isechemia and neuronal injury. We will use pharmacological tools to manipulate functionally specific RVM neuronal populations. Particular classes of RVM neurons will be indentified using standard extracellular neurophysiological recording techniques. Cognitive changes will be tested using standard learning paradigms such as the rotarod test and modified Morris water maze.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immune responses to harmless antigens, and in one form or another, affect 1 in 4 Americans in the United States with a disproportionate increase especially among children with asthma and food-related hypersensitivities. While malleable genetic and environmental components play an important role, immunological aspects associated with cellular and humoral aspects of atopy remain major risk factors underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases and allergic inflammation in general. Among the immune cells implicated in allergic disease, few have received in recent years the level of attention given to dendritic cells (DC) and basophils. DCs are best known for their capacity to act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) that induce immunological responses by presenting antigen to T cells. In mediating this activity, DCs play an important role in both the priming of adaptive immune responses and in the induction of peripheral tolerance. Ancillary studies in mice now indicate that basophils also possess APC capability that is most important in initiating the Th2 responses that are hallmark in allergic diseases. However, it remains unclear in humans whether specific DC subtypes (and/or basophils) preferentially support allergen-reactive Th2 responses, and whether/how these might be altered by immune-based intervention. Thus, three aims are proposed: Aim 1 addresses the general hypothesis that specific DC subtypes induce phenotypically and functionally distinct allergen-reactive T cell responses. In particular, experiments investigate plasmacytoid and myeloid DC (pDC and mDC, respectively) as well as basophils for their potential to differentially induce T cell responses in dust mite allergic subjects. Since new evidence points to basophils playing a role in modulating DC activity rather than acting as APCs, then this hypothesis will also be investigated. Aim 2 addresses the hypothesis that pDC, mDC, and basophils are differentially primed by innate immune stimuli (e.g. TLR ligands) and by specific cytokines (IL-3/IL-33 vs. IFN- ?) to differentially induce allergen-reactive Th2 and/or Th1 cell responses. Finally, Aim 3 addresses the hypothesis that successful Standard Immunotherapy (SIT) alters the capacity of DC subtypes (and basophils) to promote allergen-specific Th2 cell responses. In particular, our preliminary data show that SIT improves TLR9-dependent innate immune responses in DC that are impaired in allergic disease. We further predict that this increased activity will parallel with increases in IgG4 blocking activity, the induction of allergen-specific
Tregs, and clinical improvement. Our unique ability to investigate human DC and basophils makes this application highly innovative, and increases the probability that novel, significant, and clinically relevant findings will be discovered.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

This proposed study will be conducted in the Hispanic Community Health Study-Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL), an NIH-NHLBI funded study of Hispanics/Latinos in the Bronx, Miami, Chicago and San Diego. Disparate rates of disease in the Hispanic population will be addressed in the parent study and the biomarker data derived from the proposed study can improve the precision of dietary and physical activity assessments related to differences found in disease rates among Hispanic/Latino sub-groups. The biomarker data from the proposed study will have the potential to calibrate nutrient and physical activity self-report data to increase reliability of disease association analyses. The principal aims of the proposed study are to: 1) To compare energy and protein data from the 24 hr dietary recall to the gold standard biomarkers Doubly Labeled Water (DLW) for energy and urinary nitrogen for protein in the HCHS-SOL study; to compare physical activity energy expenditure data from study questionnaires to the Actical (an accelerometer for measuring physical activity), DLW and indirect calorimetry. 2) To contrast measurement error properties of: (i) the 24 hr dietary recall; (ii) the 24 hr dietary recall with the addition of the Food Propensity Questionnaire (FPQ) (iii) SOL Physical Activity Questionnaire; (iv) the Tufts University Puerto Rican/Dominican Food Frequency Questionnaire.

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder that is estimated to affect at least 1 million individuals in the U.S. and ovr 10 million worldwide. PD is a complex disorder, and no single gene has been linked to a significant percentage of cases, suggesting that environmental factors or gene-environment interactions may contribute to the etiology or clinical manifestation. A polymorphism in the xenobiotic transporter Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1, also known as P-glycoprotein) that reduces its function has been observed more frequently in PD patients who were exposed to pesticides. This finding raises the possibility that altered MDR1 function increases the risk for PD in people exposed to pesticides. Since MDR1 is critically important in expelling chemicals from the brain, we have hypothesized that MDR1 actively effluxes pesticides from the brain and genetic or acquired deficiency in this transporter may contribute to neurodegeneration. Our main research aim is to identify MDR1 as a primary efflux transporter responsible for removing pesticides, including the herbicide paraquat that has been linked to dopaminergic neurodgeneration, from the brain and protecting against neurodegeneration. This is significant because 1) MDR1 is prominently expressed in human brain capillary endothelial cells and other neuronal cells, 2) a polymorphism in MDR1 has been associated with increased risk of PD in patients exposed to pesticides, and 3) neuroinflammation, which is associated with multiple degenerative diseases including PD, has been found to down-regulate MDR1. Therefore, it is expected that these data will provide a better understanding of the genetic and inflammatory regulation of MDR1 as well as the potential role of MDR1 in the retention of pesticides in the brain, and will allow us to determine the mechanism of gene-environment interactions between MDR1, pesticides, and neurodegeneration.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is the most common disease needed surgical valve replacement. Recent studies in human patients indicate that, rather than a senile or degenerative disease; CAVS is an active complex syndrome involving multiple cellular processes. Common cardiovascular risk factors, including age, gender, abnormal lipoprotein/cholesterol profile, hypertension, and type II diabetes are all associated with CAVD; however, the association is weak in patients over 65 years old, who have the greatest risk of progressing to aortic valve stenosis. In contrast, congenital valve abnormalities markedly increase the risk. Nearly half of the patients with aortic stenosis have a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most common congenital cardiac malformation affecting 0.6% of the population. Significantly, BAV patients develop a form of rapidly progressive CAVS at an earlier age, suggesting that genetic factors are involved in the disease. However, the patients with the early stages of CAVD are symptomless and unavailable for human studies, whereas the study of the latter stages of CAVD patients is unlikely to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of CAVS. To fill this gap, we have developed novel mouse models of human CAVS. The overall goal of this project is to use these models to characterize the genetic pathways that regulate aortic valve biology and mediate CAVS. In this program, we will use these new models to examine whether Egfr, Notch1, and Nfatc1 forms a genetic network that maintains the biology of the aortic valve and mediate CAVS in three Aims. Aim 1 will determine if Notch1 and Egfr signalings interact in the VECs to maintain endothelial integrity. Aim 2 will define if Egfr protects valve from early sclerosis through Nfatc1 in the VECs. Aim 3 will identify the common downstream effectors of Notch1, Nfatc1, and Egfr involved in CAVS. Because of their central roles in differentiation, survival, and proliferation, we believe that the newly identified interactions among Egfr, Notch1, and Nfatc1 and their common downstream targets will provide novel molecular insights into the pathogenesis of CAVS. The information would have direct implications in the development of new therapeutic strategies for this most common valve disease.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a prevalent and debilitating disease without therapies that alter disease progress and is currently managed with symptom-modifying therapies that are only modestly effective. We propose a randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial of pulsed low-intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) as a novel yet well-justified treatment that could
fundamentally alter OA management.  OA affects almost 27 million Americans with an estimated annual cost of over $80 billion. The prevalence of OA is increasing rapidly. Estimates suggest that about 60 million Americans will be affected by 2030. Still greater prevalence is seen in members of the armed services, making it a disease of special importance to the Department of Veterans Affairs. OA is the leading cause of lower extremity pain and disability in older age and is the leading indication for total knee replacement (TKR), with the number of TKR procedures having more than doubled over the last decade. The increasing burden of OA is largely because available medical management addresses only pain with long-term efficacy that is marginal at best. In spite of substantial progress in understanding the pathogenesis of OA, no effective disease modifying interventions have been established.  Degenerative articular cartilage is central to the pathogenesis of OA, however, articular cartilage has limited capacity for repair. Thus, the development of OA therapeutics that focus on cartilage regeneration and repair strategies are of great importance. A large body of pre-clinical work has demonstrated the anabolic effect of mechanical stimulation on chondrocyte metabolism. Published literature from pre-clinical and clinical bone fracture and pre-clinical cartilage research indicate that effective
mechanical stimulation can be delivered via PLIUS. These consistently positive data affirm the need to investigate the potential of PLIUS as an important intervention for treatment of OA.  We propose a Phase IIa, multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, parallel, double-blind trial with a prerandomization sham run-in period to determine if PLIUS is potentially more effective than sham as a symptom- and structure-modifying intervention in patients with early OA of the knee. PLIUS will be applied using an FDA-approved device already in clinical use for bone fracture healing. The study consists of three periods: a 28-day Screening Period, a four week Prerandomization Sham Run-in Period and a 48-Week Sham-controlled Treatment Period. The three recruiting centers, the Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, and San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, have extensive experience in successfully conducting OA trials. Over a 23-month recruitment period, 178 patients with clinical and relatively early stage radiographic knee OA meeting entry criteria will be enrolled into the pre-randomization sham run- in period. A total of 160 patients who successfully completed the run-in period and continue to meet entry criteria will be randomized into the sham-controlled treatment period. All patients will be followed in the treatment period for 48 weeks, which is the time point for assessment of the co-primary outcomes of symptom relief, as assessed by the OMERACT-OARSI Responder Criteria, and structural modification, as assessed by MRI-determined medial femoral condyle cartilage thickness. Emerging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) suggests that this is a sensitive
and specific measure for structural progression of OA. Innovative and exploratory disease markers, including subchondral bone marrow lesions and soluble serum and urine biomarkers for OA will also be evaluated, along with more traditional outcomes such as the WOMAC OA Index and radiographic joint space narrowing.  The pre-clinical data supporting this study are described in the Research Plan. This project is a translational bench-to-bedside proposal targeting a highly debilitating, prevalent, and costly disease for which current treatment options are exceedingly limited. We have assembled an outstanding collaborative team of clinical scientists in leading OA centers within the Department of Veterans Affairs. If this intervention is
successful and subsequently confirmed as an effective treatment for OA in a pivotal trial, it could
fundamentally change the standard of care for this highly prevalent and debilitating disease, potentially improving the quality of life for tens of millions of veterans and other Americans.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The intestinal epithelium is a dynamic barrier that protects the body from the multitudes of bacteria that reside in the lumen. Yet multiple mechanisms exist allowing sampling of the lumen in order to promote tolerance and prevent inflammatory responses against innocuous dietary antigens. Through the use of two-photon (2p) microscopy, goblet cells (GC) were recently identified as a delivery mechanism for soluble antigen to the CD103+ dendritic cells residing in the villous lamina propria suggesting this mechanism promotes a tolerogenic immune response. We refer to these antigen delivery cells as Goblet Cell Associated Antigen Passages (GAPs). The formation of GAPs appears to be connected to the release of GC products during calcium- mediated compound exocytosis (CE), in response to acetylcholine through muscarinic receptors (mAchR). At steady-state, CE and GAP formation only occurs in the small intestine but not the colon of specific pathogen free-housed adult mice (SPF). However we did observe GAPs in the colon of germfree mice, neonatal SPF-housed mice, and Myd88-/- mice with altered microbial signaling. In this proposal, we hypothesize GAP formation and CE occurs through stimulation of the mAchR on GCs, and that this pathway is inhibited by TLR and NOD signaling in response to increased microbial growth or pathogenic infections. We propose to elucidate the details of how mAchR signaling leads to CE and where TLR and NOD intersect the signaling cascade. Through this grant, we hope to better understand how GAPs deliver antigen for the purpose of maintaining tolerogenic immune responses.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in treatment, severe mental illness (SMI) remains common, chronic and difficult to treat. SMI is defined as having at least one mental disorder that lasts for 12-months and leads to substantial life interference. Sleep and circadian dysfunctions are among the most prominent correlates of SMI, yet have been minimally studied in ways that reflect the complexity of the sleep problems experienced by people with SMI. In SMI, sleep and circadian dysfunction undermines affect regulation, cognitive function and physical health, predicts onset and worsening of symptoms and is often chronic even with evidence-based SMI treatment. Prior treatment studies have been disorder-focused-they have treated a specific sleep problem (e.g., insomnia) in a specific diagnostic group (e.g., depression). However, real life sleep and circadian problems are not so neatly categorized, particularly in SMI where features of insomnia overlap with hypersomnia, delayed sleep phase and irregular sleep-wake schedules. Accordingly, we aim to test the hypothesis that a Trans diagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) will improve functional impairment, disorder- focused symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning. We will recruit participants across DSM diagnoses and across common sleep and circadian problems. The elements of TranS-C are efficacious across SMI in research settings with research-based providers. The next step is to test TranS-C in community settings with community-based providers. Accordingly, we propose to conduct an 'efficacy in the real world' randomized controlled trial within Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBHCS), the CMHC for Alameda County. Alameda County is the most ethnically diverse county in the Bay Area. We will recruit 120 adults diagnosed with SMI and sleep and circadian dysfunction within ACBHCS. Individuals will be randomly allocated to TranS-C (n = 60) or 6-months of Usual Care followed by Delayed Treatment with TranS-C (UC- DT; n = 60). TranS-C is modularized and delivered across eight 50-minute, weekly, individual sessions. All participants will be assessed before, immediately following treatment and again 6 months later. Mediation analyses will examine whether improved sleep and circadian rhythm functioning mediate improvements in primary outcomes. Moderation analyses will examine if intervention efficacy is related to previously reported risk factors including demographics, symptom severity, medications, site, and season of treatment as well as psychiatric and medical comorbidity. This application is responsive to NIMH priorities focusing on implementing effective services in the community as well as treatments that are personalized, generalizable and not constrained by diagnostic criteria. RDoC is addressed by recruiting participants across diagnoses and defining sleep and circadian dysfunction broadly. The 'sleep-wake' and 'biological rhythms' constructs from the Arousal and Modulatory Systems domain are intervention targets and outcome measures. Our long-term objective is to establish the potential for widespread dissemination of TranS-C.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease remains the primary cause of death and disability in the United States. Death is most commonly a direct result of ventricular arrhythmia which, in turn, is the consequence of alternations in ion channel function, affecting action potentials and cell-cell communication. Altered ion channel function in failing hearts also limits the heart's contractility, further worsening heart failure and the vicious cycle towards arrhythmia and death. Individual ion channels have half-lives that are on the order of hours, and a major cause of altered ion channel function in failing hearts is altered trafficking. Altered trafficking implies that the channels are not delivered to the correct subdomain on the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane (forward trafficking), or are removed incorrectly (reverse trafficking or internalization). Altered forward and reverse trafficking are components of most cardiac disorders. However the mechanisms of forward and reverse trafficking of membrane proteins, especially of cardiac ion channels, remain poorly understood.  My laboratory explores the basic mechanisms of cardiac ion channel trafficking. In this competitive renewal, we will identify three novel pathways with strong preliminary data for each. The channels of interest are the Connexin43 gap junction channel responsible for cell-cell communication, and the L-type Calcium Channel (alpha subunit Cav1.2), which is responsible for triggering the beat-to- beat intracellular calcium transient which initiates and helps determine the strength of each cardiac contraction. Each of the three pathways explored is a separate specific aim of this proposal.  Aim #1 is to determine if alternative translation is a mechanism of Cx43 auto regulation of forward traffic in health and disease. We have evidence in human heart that as many as six in frame AUG sequences initiate translation within the Cx43 (GJA1) exon. Our data indicate the truncated Cx43 isoforms are necessary at least for Cx43 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.  Aim #2 is to determine how the actin cytoskeleton contributes to directed channel delivery. Our studies indicate that the majority of intracellular Cx43 is moving slowly or not moving at all, due to association with actin. We have developed a novel microfluidics based cell patterning system to quantify actin dynamics and its contribution to ion channel trafficking and are finding that actin is important to working with microtubules in providing specificity of Cx43 and Cav1.2 delivery.  Aim #3 is to elucidate the post-translation cascade by which Cx43 is internalized from the plasma membrane. We have evidence that serine 373 phosphorylation on the Cx43 C-terminus needs to precede serine 368 phopsphorylation. Our new data will explore mechanism of phosphorylation dependent internalization and whether the products of alternative translation are involved.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aortic wall stiffness is a fundamental biomechanical parameter that reflects the structural integrity of normal and aneurysmal aortic tissue. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) enlarge over time and lead to sudden rupture and death in up to 90% of patients. Surgical or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is recommended for AAAs > 5.5 cm in diameter. However, smaller AAAs (< 5 cm) progress to rupture, and larger AAAs (> 5 cm) remain stable. It is shown that rate of AAA expansion is a better indicator of AAA rupture than AAA diameter. However, rate of AAA expansion is not able to identify patients who present initially with impending AAA rupture and therefore depend on AAA diameter for initial assessment. Despite the poor prognostic value of aortic diameter, it is still the primary parameter used to time surgical repair. It is known that changes in stiffness of AAA can reveal important information on extra-cellular matrix content; a key factor in the pathophysiological development of AAA and the risk for rupture. Therefore, a non-invasive, spatially resolved estimate of aortic stiffness may provide a superior determinant of the risk for rupture compared to the currently used anatomical measures. The relationship between non-invasively measured wall stiffness (WS) and the structural integrity of the aortic wall must be further elucidated. To date, aortic stiffness has been measured with invasive catheter or non-invasive ultrasound-based methods, such as pulse-wave velocity (PWV) or pulse-wave imaging (PWI), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based PWV to provide only an indirect global estimate of aortic WS. Furthermore, these methods can neither spatially resolve WS (important in understanding AAA formation), nor temporally resolve the aortic WS across the cardiac cycle; this is critical since the loading conditions (i.e., pressure) changes across the cardiac cycle and influences stiffness estimates. Because of these limitations, indirect measurements of global aortic stiffness via catheter, ultrasound, or MRI have not been widely adopted. The PI's lab has developed a novel, non-invasive, 3D spatially and temporally resolved measure of aortic stiffness termed Aortic Magnetic Resonance Elastography (AMRE). We hypothesize that this innovative AMRE-derived stiffness will improve our understanding of AAA pathogenesis and provide superior prognostic information compared to aortic diameter. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to validate in-vivo AMRE against both ex-vivo mechanical testing and histopathology; and to determine the correlation between AAA WS and AAA progression.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe pulmonary hypertension is a progressive and irreversible disease that often leads to mortality due to right heart failure. The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension involves proliferation of cells, including endothelial cells (intimal remodeling), in the vessel walls of pulmonary arteries resulting in remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. Several factors implicated in the remodeling process are driven by hypoxia. One mechanism by which cells respond to hypoxia is by stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. Independent studies suggest that both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are important mediators in PH. However, recent investigations have reported a marked increase in HIF-2alpha gene locus polymorphism in individuals adapting to high altitudes, suggesting a role of HIF-2alpha in PH. Mechanism by which HIF-2alpha influences pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, independent of HIF-1alpha is not known. This proposal is focused on understanding the role of HIF-2alpha and its pathways in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.  We have recently identified a new pathway, the HIF-2alpha-A2A receptor pathway, by which HIF-2alpha can promote endothelial proliferation, independent of HIF-1alpha. We hypothesize that hypoxia increases endothelial  proliferation and vascular remodeling through a HIF-2alpha and A2A receptor-dependent mechanism and that this  is an important step in the pathogenesis of PH. Additionally, we have also identified HIF-1alpha in smooth muscle  cell proliferation, independent of HIF-2alpha. The proposed studies are divided into three aims. Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms by which hypoxia and HIFs influence endothelial growth using cultured primary pulmonary endothelial cells as well as endothelial cells derived from hypertensive rats. The second aim will be used to test the hypothesis that inhibition or knockdown of HIFs, particularly HIF-2alpha will limit vascular remodeling and PA pressures in a rat model of PAH. The third aim will test whether inhibition or knockdown of A2A receptor, a downstream transcriptional target of HIF-2alpha, can mitigate remodeling and PA pressures in a rat model of PAH.  The in vivo aims will investigate effects using both a prevention model and a rescue model. Results of the proposed research will help provide insights into hypoxic pathways that influence pulmonary vascular remodeling and offer alternative targets for treatment of PH.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Graft vascular disease (GVD) is the single greatest barrier to the long-term success of solid-organ transplantation. The lesions of GVD characteristically show concentric vascular intimal hyperplasia composed of smooth muscle-like cells (SMLCs) and associated extracellular matrix; this intimal expansion develops diffusely throughout the vasculature of transplanted organs, eventually limiting their arterial conduit function and causing graft ischemia and failure. Experimental allografts placed in Colony Stimulating Factor-1 (CSF- 1, also known as M-CSF)-deficient osteopetrotic (op) mice show greatly reduced accumulation of neointimal SMLCs compared to those placed in control recipients, suggesting that CSF-1, the principal mediator of macrophage differentiation, activation, and survival, has a significant role in GVD. In recent studies, we used op mice, reconstituted by transgenesis to express specific isoforms of CSF-1, as either donors or recipients in carotid arterial allograft transplantation. We found that lack of all CSF-1 in recipients significantly limited neointimal hyperplasia, while recipient expression of cell surface
(cs) CSF-1 alone was sufficient for neointimal expansion. Surprisingly, absence of CSF-1 in donor tissue also impaired neointima formation; this reduction was also completely reversed when donor tissue expressed the cs isoform alone. Neointimal SMLCs expressed the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) encoded by the c-fms oncogene, and antibody-mediated blockade of this receptor inhibited SMLC proliferation in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest that CSF-1, expressed on the surface of both donor and recipient derived cells, can act in a local, autocrine/juxtacrine manner in GVD to stimulate chronic neointimal SMLC proliferation and eventual vascular obstruction. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that an essential function of CSF-1 signaling in GVD pathogenesis resides not only in its ability to stimulate its classical cellular target, the macrophage, but also in its effects on neointimal SMLCs that express the CSF-1R. To test this hypothesis and assess therapeutic opportunities that it suggests, we propose three aims: first, we will identify the essential cell type(s) through which CSF-1 drives GVD; second, we will test the effectiveness of pharmacologic CSF-1R inhibitors for prevention and regression of GVD in mouse transplantation models; and third, we will examine clinical transplant tissues, including grafts with advanced GVD, for evidence of expression and activation of the CSF-1 signaling pathway in human GVD. These studies will advance understanding of how CSF-1 signaling promotes GVD and evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target that can be readily translated into clinical practice to mitigate graft failure.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[ABSTRACT
 Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) are characterized by disability and exercise
intolerance which impair their quality of life and depict a major source of morbidity in this
population. A cardinal determinant of these characteristics is the occurrence of premature
fatigue during physical activity. Based on earlier studies in healthy young humans, neural
feedback from mechano- and/or metabosensitive group III and IV muscle afferents, well-known
to be abnormally elevated in patients with HF, might play a key role in these abnormalities.
However, even in healthy older humans, our understanding of the exact role / relative
contribution of group III/IV muscle afferents to the development of fatigue during exercise is
incomplete. By studying patients with HF with preserved (HFPEF) as well as reduced (HFREF)
ejection fraction and age- and activity-matched healthy controls (CTRLs), we will evaluate the
impact of heart failure on a) the precise development of central and peripheral fatigue during
exercise, and b) the relative contribution of group III/IV muscle afferents to exercise tolerance
and fatigue resistance during physical activity in humans. Specifically, we will compare the
development of central and peripheral fatigue during whole body (i.e. bicycle) as well as single
muscle (i.e. single leg knee-extension) exercise in HFPEF, HFREF, and CTRLs (using electric
femoral nerve stimulation, electric cervicomedullary stimulation, and transcranial magnetic
stimulation techniques). Furthermore, we will use lumbar intrathecal fentanyl to temporarily
block the central projection of group III/IV muscle afferents during exercise (lumbar intrathecal
has no concomitant effect on feedforward drive at a given absolute workload). This unique and
previously proven approach to temporarily block group III/IV muscle afferent feedback will
enable us to evaluate the effects of these sensory neurons on the development of central and
peripheral fatigue during large and small muscle mass rhythmic exercise in CTRLS and in
patients with HF. The knowledge gained from this research in humans with different types of
HF will contribute to a better understanding of the role of muscle afferent feedback as a
potential mechanism underlying the premature fatigue characterizing this population.
Additionally, if we can confirm preliminary findings demonstrating that blocking the abnormal
feedback from the muscles in HF reduces the debilitating effects of fatigue in this population,
then we could provide a theoretical foundation for the design of new and innovative
pharmaceutical and especially rehabilitative treatment strategies. For example, the innovation
of a specific therapy that down-regulates the feedback from these sensory nerves to the brain
and spinal cord, may effectively improve the patients' success in cardiac rehabilitation and
consequently quality of life and mortality.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Healthy People 2020 goals highlight the need to address social determinants of health to achieve health equity and eliminate health disparities. In the U.S., large racial and socioeconomic disparities in childhood mortality have persisted over time, and are, in fact, widening. Poverty is an overarching risk factor for infant and child mortality, and socioeconomic planning will need to be part of the solution in addition to other health policy. The extant literature is replete with conceptual papers on ecological models and descriptive papers about the extent of disparities, but very few controlled empirical evaluations of the effects of specific laws and policies on disparities. Thus, the proposed intensively longitudinal empirical evaluation of the health effects of policies shaping family economic conditions will substantially advance understanding of how policies can be optimally used to reduce childhood mortality and disparities among low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority children and youth. We propose a 3-phase study, including an intensively longitudinal empirical evaluation of the effects of multiple state-level policies for which there is a strong theoretical basis to expect effects on health disparities. First, we will create a new Family Economic Security Policy Surveillance system with legal/policy data collection and analysis for numerous laws, regulations and specific policies across all 50 states continuously from 1980 to present. Second, we will implement a 35-year 50-state study of geographic and time dispersion to assess the distributions of policies across time and space. Spatial and time analysis will help to delineate solutions for geographic disparities across the U.S. Third, we will evaluate overall effects and differential effects by race/ethnicity and SES of multiple laws and policies on low birth weight, infant mortality and all-cause and cause-specific childhood mortality. We have designed an intensive longitudinal design that takes maximum advantage of over three decades of data across the 50 U.S. states to assess effects of policy changes on childhood mortality and disparities. We will employ an interrupted time-series analysis with matched comparison states propensity-score based synthetic control groups, and nationwide covariate controls to maximize statistical power and strength of causal inference. The scientific results of the proposed study will directly guide law-making to effectively and efficiently improve infant and child outcomes and
reduce health and social inequalities and disparities.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extra-coding features of mRNA are essential for hERG channel function  This hERG potassium channel plays an essential role in cardiac repolarization, and malfunction of this channel caused by mutation leads to Long QT Syndrome, type 2 (LQT2). LQT2 results in delayed repolarization of the cardiac myocyte, leading to ventricular arrhythmias, syncope and sudden death. There are over 600 documented mutations in KCNH2 associated with Long QT syndrome and these mutations occur throughout the length of the gene, without definitive mutational hotspots. Little investigation has been focused on what causes the hERG channel to be intolerant to mutation. Our hypothesis is that extra-coding features on the mRNA level, such as GC content, rare codon usage and mRNA structure contribute to determining correct protein synthesis of the hERG channel, and that mutational changes that disrupt these features lead to Long QT Syndrome. Previous studies from our lab support this hypothesis. HERG-CM, a codon modified version of the hERG mRNA, was made with reduced GC content (51%) and decreased use of rare codons, while maintaining the exact amino acid sequence. hERG-CM protein was translated and trafficked differently than the native hERG (hERG-NT) channel. To further understand the mechanism behind these observations, Ribosomal Profiling will be used to investigate differences in ribosomal movement across the hERG-NT and - CM mRNA. Capillary Electrophoresis will also be used to investigate structural differences between these two mRNAs. We hypothesize that the sites of ribosomal pausing, caused by rare codons or mRNA structure, allow for important secondary and tertiary structure formation and trafficking of the HERG protein. These pausing locations in the hERG-NT and -CM mRNAs will be investigated, and correlated with known LQT2 mutations to investigate their impact on Long QT pathogenesis. The influence of these extra-coding features of the mRNA on protein folding will also be investigated, through pulse proteolysis, to examine differences in intermediate or final folded structure. hERG-CM and hERG-NT protein function will also be assessed through electrophysiology. Successful completion of this project will provide novel information on how mRNA impacts not only the primary structure of a protein, but also the folding intermediates, translational efficiency, trafficking efficiency, and function of the protei product. Ongoing studies will have implications for evaluation and treatment of hereditary and acquired arrhythmias.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microtubule-based motor complexes drive and regulate the intracellular distribution of countless cargos, ranging from organelles and vesicles to mRNAs. While clearly essential for all eukaryotic cells, nowhere is this process more crucial than in neurons, where intracellular transport deficiencies can underly devastating neuro- degenerative conditions. Several theories have been vying to explain how kinesins and dyneins, molecular motors that pull cargos towards opposite poles of microtubules, work with and/or against each other to achieve regulated bi-directional transport. A growing number of studies point to a constant tug-of-war wherein kinesins and dyneins are simultaneously active and working against each other, though this model has never been directly proven in living cells. An ideal strategy to pick apart the contributions of individual motors within the complex would be to photo-inactivate them, then observe the immediate aftermath on moving cargos. However, since such a method for in vivo photo-inactivation doesn't exist in today's molecular toolbox, we set out to create it. As a result, we have developed a small-molecule dimerizer that can be photo-cleaved with targeted laser light. The novel compound, which we have named zapalog, can be used to dimerize any two recombinant proteins/peptides tagged with the zapalog- binding domains, and this dimerization can then be immediately reversed by zapalog photo-cleavage. We propose to verify, characterize and optimize this novel compound, then use it to adhere engineered Kinesin-1 motor domains to their corresponding cargo binding domains in cultured rat neurons and Aspergillas nidulans, effectively re-creating functional kinesin molecules that are susceptible to photo-destruction inside living cells. The ability to instantaneously remove the
kinesins from moving cargo affords us a unique position to finally test the tug-of-war model in vivo, by observing the immediate aftermath of kinesin loss on motor complex behavior in living cells. Does a cargo moving anterograde simply stop or does it promptly reverse direction as the dynein motor is no longer opposed? Does a retrogradely moving cargo continue as before or are its speed and processivity suddenly enhanced by the absence of opposing kinesins? Beyond providing an answer to the illusive tug-of-war model, this new technique could become a very valuable tool for a broad range of cell biology questions, as it can be used to integrate in
vivo photo-inactivation as well as photo-activation modalities into almost any protein of interest.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite increasing evidence that circulating maternal antibodies can produce disease in the fetus and that anti- brain antibodies are associated with an ever-expanding number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, there is little information concerning when and how antibodies enter the brain, particularly of the fetus during pregnancy. We have previously proposed that gestational exposure to maternal antibodies is associated with the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human offspring. To support this contention, we exposed pregnant rhesus monkeys to purified IgG obtained from mothers who harbor anti-fetal brain antibodies and have given birth to children with ASD. The rhesus offspring demonstrated behavioral and brain growth alterations that are consistent with ASD. Nonetheless, substantial skepticism remains with the notion that unusual maternal antibodies are pathogenic for ASD. This is due, in part, to the fact that there is so little evidence concernig the entry of antibodies into the fetal brain and the mechanisms by which they might alter brain development leading to ASD. In fact, while papers by Coe and colleagues indicate that maternal antibodies cross the placenta during the latter half of pregnancy in the rhesus monkey, we have not been able to find a single publication that determines whether and when these antibodies enter the fetal monkey brain. To investigate this issue, we have recruited a team of investigators with expertise in neuroscience, immunology, fetal development of the nonhuman primate, and positron emission tomography (PET) to carry out studies with the overarching goal of providing evidence for transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies and entry into the fetal brain. While there are several potential strategies for carrying out these studies, we have focused on PET imaging with the hope that this will establish expertise and a protocol for noninvasively evaluating antibody entry into the central nervous system of the nonhuman primate at various ages. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the occurrence of transplacental transport of 124I-labeled IgG into the fetal rhesus monkey brain at three developmental time points in the second and third trimesters. Entry of IgG into the brain will be assessed both by PET and by fetal tissue harvests followed by brain dissection and evaluation for radioactivity using a gamma counter. We will use a monoclonal antibody to GPM6A which is a tetraspan membrane protein abundant on neuronal surfaces in the central nervous system. Evaluation of gene and protein databases indicate that this protein is abundant throughout fetal life both in the nonhuman primate (http://www.blueprintnhpatlas.org) and in the human (http://www.brainspan.org/), and is a component of the human surfaceome. Specific Aim 2 will carry out longitudinal PET scans to identify quantitative changes of IgG entry into the fetal brain from midgestation to near term. The
studies described here are a first step towards developing a nonhuman primate model of antibody-induced psychiatric illness and establishing the mechanisms through which anti-brain antibodies might influence brain development, brain function and behavior.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly recurrent, disabling illness, and emerging data indicate that, for women with BD, the perinatal period is particularly destabilizing. Prospective studies have revealed mood episode morbidity in up to 70% of pregnant women with the disorder, and risk of postpartum mania in as high as 50% of cases. Negative sequelae of BD for expectant and new mothers include severe psychosocial impairment, substantial suicide risk, and rates of postpartum psychosis 100 times greater than in the general public. Moreover, infants of pregnant women with BD are significantly more likely to experience adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, small for gestational age, and microcephaly. Despite these risks, as well as expert recommendations for prophylactic mood stabilization at a minimum effective dose throughout the perinatal period, rates of medication discontinuation are as high as 70% among pregnant and postpartum women with BD. Thus, a critical need exists to find ways to increase appropriate treatment engagement among perinatal women with BD. As a first step toward developing interventions that attempt to increase treatment engagement, it is important to understand factors that limit effective treatment utilization. The proposed study would be the first to examine these questions, integrating quantitative and qualitative methods to elucidate the processes by which perinatal women choose to continue or discontinue BD pharmacotherapy. Eighty pregnant women with BD, half of whom recently discontinued their BD pharmacotherapy, will complete assessments during pregnancy and again at three months postpartum that assess medication utilization, BD symptoms, treatment attitudes, and illness-related cognitions. A subset of the overall sample (n=24) will take part in a qualitative interview to obtain more in-depth information regarding women's treatment decisions regarding perinatal BD care. Women's medication providers (n=up to 80) will also be assessed. The three primary aims of this study are: (1) To test the hypothesis that women's illness-related cognitions account for unique variance in medication continuation decisions, over and above clinical characteristics and treatment attitudes; (2) To utilize qualitative measures to further explore the decision-making process and develop a model reflecting the relative contribution of factors influencing medication continuation decisions; (3) To integrate findings from both quantitative and qualitative phases of the research to develop specific recommendations regarding optimal decision support strategies for women and providers. On an exploratory level (4), this study aims to examine associations between prenatal pharmacotherapy continuation and subsequent treatment decisions and maternal symptom, functioning, and birth outcomes at three months postpartum. Ultimately, this project will lead to a
more comprehensive understanding of why perinatal women with BD often discontinue pharmacotherapy, as well as specific recommendations for future interventions, such as prenatal decision support strategies, to address this serious problem.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African trypanosomiasis, also called African sleeping sickness, infects tens of thousands of individuals yearly in endemic areas, and is accompanied by continuing high social and economic cost. Existing treatments for trypanosomiasis are woefully inadequate, due both to the emergence of drug resistance that results in high treatment failures rates (30% in some areas), and high toxicity resulting in significant morbidity (10%) and drug-related mortality (5%). There thus remains an outstanding need for rational design of new trypanocidal therapies, particularly those that minimize host toxicity by targeting unique trypanosome biology. Glucose metabolism is the sole source of ATP for the infectious lifecycle stage of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, and enzymes central to sugar metabolism are housed in the glycosome, an organelle not found in the parasite's mammalian host(s). Hence, both glycosome function and the control mechanisms governing enzyme activity inside the glycosome are important targets for drug design. We have demonstrated that ATP production in this organism is sensitive to environmentally-influenced changes in glycosomal solution conditions, including pH. Characterizing the intraglycosomal environment is therefore a necessary step in understanding essential glycolytic pathways, and would lay the groundwork for development of anti-trypanosome therapies that target control of glucose metabolism. However, this information is currently lacking at the most basic level. Neither pH nor glucose has been quantified inside the glycosome and their environmentally influenced dynamic range(s) are unknown, a paucity that reflects the historical lack of methodologies to allow quantitative intraglycosomal measurement. Here we propose development of peptide-targeted small molecule and recombinant protein-based sensors to quantitatively determine intraglycosomal pH and glucose levels. Our preliminary data indicates that such sensors can be delivered to the glycosomes of live parasites. Developed sensors can be subsequently modified for measurement of other glycosomal solutes, including ATP, and used to investigate control of glycolysis as a response to other potentially important environmental and developmental conditions, including glucose and divalent salt concentrations, nutrient depletion, and calcium signaling. Resulting findings will illuminate the mechanisms of dynamic regulation of the glycosomal environment, reveal conditions that influence the activity of this essential metabolic pathway, and introduce methodologies likely facilitate a series of new approaches to understanding and testing parasite metabolism. Notably, techniques pioneered in this study can be extended to analysis of other pathogenic kinetoplastid parasites, such as Trypanasoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. that also localize ATP production in glycosomes. In addition, the methodologies can be modified to evaluate the intraorganellar environment in other important subcellular compartments such as the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. The work is therefore likely to have impact(s) beyond African trypanosomiasis.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pneumococcal vaccination is underused in underserved minorities, who are at greater pneumococcal disease risk. Two vaccines are available, the older pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). However, the optimally protective vaccination regimen is unclear, due to changing epidemiology and uncertain vaccine effectiveness; both should become clearer soon. Current CDC vaccination recommendations are complex and may not optimally protect the underserved, due multiple barriers to effective implementation. Vaccine uptake could improve with either better implementation of cur- rent recommendations or broader CDC recommendations that are easier to implement, which could have pro-portionately greater effects on the underserved. Clinical trials comparing these strategies are unlikely and, due to the moving target of vaccination-related epidemiologic changes and US Affordable Care Act (ACA) effects on vaccination rates, could be unhelpful. To investigate these issues, a systematic synthesis of available data and evidence-based projections with rigor- ous modeling of uncertainty is planned to assist policymaking and inform research resource allocation. Potential changes to decrease the complexity of pneumococcal vaccination recommendations (using PPSV and/or PCV13) will be modeled and compared to current recommendations implemented under programs to improve vaccination rates. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the public health impact on underserved minority populations of potential CDC adult pneumococcal vaccination recommendations, specifically addressing age-based vs. the more complex comorbidity-based use of vaccine; and 2) determine the public health impact and cost- effectiveness of implementation programs to improve vaccination rates in underserved minorities and persons <65 with high risk conditions, compared to potential CDC vaccination recommendations from Aim 1. Vaccination strategies will be compared via Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis and value of information analysis to determine favored strategies and identify the most valuable areas for future research. Analyses will also innovatively use the CDC-recommended RE-AIM framework to evaluate implementation program options and explore interactions between ACA effects, potential CDC recommendations, and race-specific pneumococcal disease characteristics. Since CDC vaccination recommendation evaluations increasingly consider economic analyses, analysis results can be used, as they have previously, to assist vaccination recommendation decisions and potentially change vaccination policy to better protect the underserved.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 integrase (IN) has an essential, multifunctional role in virus replication and serves as an important therapeutic target. During the early stage of HIV-1 replication IN catalyzes the covalent insertion of viral cDNA into the host chromosome. This process is mediated by cellular chromatin associated protein LEDGF/p75, which both markedly enhances integration efficiency and preferentially guides HIV-1 integration to actively transcribed genes. Structural interactions between HIV-1 IN and LEDGF/p75 have been well characterized, but until recently little was known about how LEDGF/p75 recognizes select chromatin sites. During the past funding cycle we have elucidated structural and mechanistic basis for preferential and tight binding of the PWWP domain, the key chromatin binding module of LEDGF/p75, to cognate mononucleosomes (MNs). In particular, we have demonstrated that cooperative binding of the hydrophobic cavity and basic surface of LEDGF PWWP to the histone H3 tail containing trimethylated Lys36 (H3K36me3) and DNA wrapped in MNs is essential for high-affinity binding of LEDGF/p75 to chromatin. These studies will now be extended in aim 1 to characterize the interplay between full-length LEDGF/p75, H3K36me3 epigenetic marks, and HIV-1 integration sites in vitro and in infected cells. Aim 2 of the present application will focus on testing the hypothesis that HIV-1 IN plays an active role during the viru particle maturation. The rationale for this notion was provided by previous findings that certain substitutions in the IN coding region or addition of allosteric IN inhibitors induce eccentric maturation of virus particles. A hallmark of this eccentric phenotype is the mislocalization of the
ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in mature virions. While infectious virions contain RNPs embedded within the capsid core, the eccentric particles have RNPs localized between the empty or translucent capsid core and the particle membrane. These experiments have highlighted a potential role of IN during the late steps of virus maturation. However, little is known as to how IN could contribute to proper particle morphogenesis. Here, we present our preliminary data showing that HIV-1 IN interacts directly and with high affinity with highly structured viral RNA segments in vitro and in virus particles. These preliminary findings suggest previously undescribed roles of HIV-1 IN during virus particle maturation and provide compelling rationale for our structural and virology studies proposed in aim 2. The proposed experiments are expected to fill the critical gap in our knowledge of how multifunctional IN contributes to the
late stage of HIV-1 replication.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Following a neurological injury such as a stroke, functional mobility is often limited. One potential cause of reduced mobility is decreased gait stability, as evidenced by the increased risk of falls after a stroke. A second potential cause of reduced mobility is an increased energetic cost of walking, which in combination with reduced cardiovascular capacity can lead to activity-limiting fatigue. This project proposes that both the decreased gait stability and increased energetic cost seen after a stroke can be partially attributed to altered sensorimotor integration, as indicated by a decreased capacity to accurately control voluntary movement. Accurate motor control requires the ability to produce the intended muscle activation pattern (actuation accuracy) and the ability to sense the mechanical state of the moving body segment using feedback from the periphery (sensation accuracy), both abilities which are commonly reduced after a stroke. The proposed experiments will test whether reductions in control accuracy affect stability and energetic cost, based on the predictions of mechanical models. The first objective of the proposed project is to identify the effects of reduced control accuracy on lateral gait stability following a stroke. Simple mechanical models predict that sagittal plane gai stability can be maintained passively in response to small perturbations, but frontal plane stability requires active control. The simplest control strategy to maintain lateral stability is t choose an appropriate mediolateral foot placement of the swing leg, with more lateral foot placement requiring less accurate control. The proposed experiments will test whether decreased control accuracy explains altered frontal plane mechanics following a stroke. The primary anticipated result of these experiments is that delivering enhanced sensory feedback to persons who have experienced a stroke will restore a more typical gait pattern, a finding with clear clinical implications. The second objective of the proposed project is to quantify the contribution of limited control accuracy to the increased energetic cost of movement following a stroke. In typical gait, energetic economy is improved by storing and returning mechanical energy in the elastic Achilles tendon, allowing strong push-off without requiring large amounts of plantarflexor muscle work. Similarly, the energetic demand of bouncing can be substantially reduced by taking advantage of tendon elasticity, while the simplicity of the task in comparison to walking eases quantification of system mechanics. The proposed experiments will quantify the effect on bouncing efficiency of: 1) altered mechanical tissue properties, specifically reduced
tendon stiffness; 2) changes in efficiency of the muscular conversion of metabolic energy to mechanical energy; 3) an inability to identify the optimal movement pattern using sensory feedback. The primary anticipated result is that following a stroke, patients will be unable to identify the pattern of movement that takes optimal advantage of system mechanics. By choosing a non-optimal movement pattern, energetic cost will be increased.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

easily, complained of cold extremities and showed an inability to do prolonged mental or physical work; he
was quoted as saying; they are not exactly ill; yet they are rarely well. 1 However, several more recent
papers have challenged the notion that low BP is a health concern, and even suggest that hypotension is
the ideal normal BP.2, 3 Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) above T5 are reported to struggle with
chronic hypotension,4-11 episodic orthostatic hypotension (OH) 12-16 and post-prandial hypotension.17 In
fact, we recently reported that, over the course of a typical 24-hour day, the incidence of hypotension was

incidence of hypotension is 2.5 fold increased in veterans with SCI compared to age-matched veterans
without SCI. However, chronic hypotension is often not clinically addressed because the vast majority of
hypotensive individuals remain asymptomatic. That said there evidence in the general medical literature
supporting associations between asymptomatic hypotension, cognitive deficits, adverse changes in mood

significant associations between chronic hypotension and increased incidence of depression,23-30
anxiety,25, 26 unexplained tiredness,24, 31 and poor perception of well being.32 Although many hypotensive
individuals with chronic SCI remain asymptomatic and do not raise clinical suspicion warranting
intervention, we believe, and have demonstrated that asymptomatic chronic hypotension has adverse
cognitive consequences.33-35 It must be appreciated that the superimposition of cognitive impairment on
the physical, social and emotional limitations already experienced by many individuals with SCI may
severely impact autonomy and social independence thereby diminishing QOL.36, 37 There is compelling
evidence in the general medical literature suggesting that elevation in systemic BP, following midodrine
hydrochloride administration, increases resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and improves CBF responses to
cognitive testing resulting in better test performance in healthy individuals with chronic hypotension. 38, 39
Because it is believed that the etiology of hypotension in the SCI population is the result of adrenergic
insufficiency, midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, is considered a first line treatment, 40-42 and we have
demonstrated significant increases in systemic BP in hypotensive individuals with SCI.43, 44 However, in
general, data describing the BP effect of midodrine have been collected in small samples of hypotensive
subjects with SCI during laboratory observations,44, 45 the benefit of sustained elevation in systemic BP on
CBF, cognitive function, mood and QOL has not been rigorously studied in the SCI population. Data
generated in this pilot project will be used to power a large-scale clinical trial to determine the
clinical benefit of sustained increases in BP on CBF, cognitive function, mood and QOL in persons
with SCI.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
Between 2001 and 2010, more than 130,000 active service members received diagnoses of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, with annual incidence rates more than doubling over this period. Over 68,000 days of lost duty time were attributed to disc degeneration-specific diagnoses. Military training and operations are inherently physically demanding, placing military service members at increased risk for IVD degeneration and related neck and back pain. Among Veterans, chronic back pain accounts for over 70 percent of chiropractic visits and in many cases is directly connected to their period of service. Despite the prevalence and soaring costs, there is no specific treatment that restores physiological functions of the diseased IVD.  The objective of this pilot study is to confirm that young allogeneic articular chondrocytes, especially those induced to overexpress growth factors (e.g., bone morphogenetic protein, BMP-7) are effective in repairing the degenerating IVD. Articular chondrocytes would be an appropriate cell source because they already have a phenotype similar to that of the IVD cells, and, unlike native disc cells, have greater potential for clinical translation through allogeneic transplantation. Young chondrocytes will be used here because a body of literature supports the notion that young cells possess more regenerative capacity than older cells by rejuvenating host tissue via trophic factors. Our team has pioneered the development of a rabbit IVD-injury model which is ideally suited to evaluating cell-based therapeutics.  Our preliminary data have shown that young allogeneic articular chondrocytes injected into the center of the injured rabbit IVD survived and reduced inflammation of the host tissue. In the proposed study, hydrogels with distinct properties will be assessed as scaffold that may prevent leakage from the injection needle track and enhance biomechanical properties of the repaired IVD. The injectable implants shown to mimic the native NP in mechanics will be more likely to induce the appropriate phenotype in the cells as the disc is loaded in vivo. Specifically, our group has developed hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels conducive to preservation of chondrocyte phenotype and growth, which solidify at body temperature and are thus ideal for injection therapies. We have also tested a triple-interpenetrating-network (TIN) hydrogel that enhances biomechanical properties of the repaired IVD. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that transplanting articular chondrocytes seeded in hydrogels will repopulate the IVD thus reducing inflammation and enhancing biomechanical properties by providing trophic factors and synthesizing extracellular matrix. Two specific aims are proposed, to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will compare the HA and TIN gel in supporting transplanted articular chondrocyte survival and reducing host inflammatory responses in the rabbit IVD-injury model. The hydrogel that best supports cell survival and reduces host inflammation will be further tested. In Aim 2, we will determine the therapeutic effects of young articular chondrocytes on injured mature rabbit IVDs. The effects of chondrocytes (native or overexpressing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7) on the host IVD inflammation, biomechanical properties, and tissue structure will be determined.  We expect that IVDs repaired with chondrocytes seeded in hydrogel will show improved biomechanical properties, decreased inflammation, and improved morphology. These studies in the rabbit will lay the groundwork for clinical studies that will test if transplanted chondrocytes
are effective in reducing disc degeneration and back pain, thus benefiting patients.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[Abstract. Immune tolerance expands to accommodate foreign paternal antigens expressed by the developing
fetus during pregnancy. This vital process requires sustained expansion of a dedicated immune suppressive
maternal CD4+ T cell subset, called regulatory T cells (Tregs), whereas blunted maternal Treg accumulation
occurs in spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications linked with fractured fetal
tolerance. This necessity for maternal Tregs is reinforced in animals where even partial transient depletion
from expanded pregnancy levels disrupts fetal tolerance and triggers fetal wastage. One important, but
relatively uncharacterized feature of Tregs lies in their antigen specificity. Like other T cells, individual Tregs
have defined specificity, and T cell receptor stimulation is required for activating their suppressive properties.
By combining tetramer enrichment for tracking rare CD4+ T cells based on defined specificity and the use of
transgenic mice that ubiquitously express defined model antigens to sire pregnancy in non-transgenic females
that transforms model antigens into surrogate fetal antigens, our initial studies show pregnancy primes robust
expansion of maternal Tregs with fetal specificity. By extending this analysis after parturition, maintenance of
maternal Tregs with pre-existing fetal specificity, and their more robust re-accumulation with fetal-antigen re-
stimulation in subsequent pregnancies were also revealed. In turn, sharply increased resiliency against fetal
wastage during secondary compared with primary pregnancy coincides with this expanded pool of fetal-
specific memory Tregs. These results highlighting potential protective memory features for maternal Tregs are
in agreement, and may provide a scientific basis to explain human partner-specific protective benefits of prior
successful pregnancy against complications in subsequent pregnancies. Nonetheless, despite this association,
what remains unknown is whether fetal-specific memory Tregs confer protection against fetal wastage.
Addressing these critical gaps in knowledge require new strategies for in vivo manipulation of maternal Tregs
with defined fetal specificity. Our overall hypothesis is that maintenance of maternal memory Tregs requires
ongoing stimulation by fetal cells that establish microchimerism in mothers after pregnancy. In turn, depletion
of microchimeric fetal cells allows the necessity of memory Tregs in protection against fetal wastage during
later pregnancies to be investigated. Furthermore, if postpartum maintenance of regulatory tolerance is
restricted to antigens expressed by microchimeric fetal cells, the transient pregnancy-induced remission and
swift postpartum recurrence of organ-specific autoimmune disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis) may reflect
inadequate expression of tissue restricted self antigens by fetal microchimeric cells. Therefore, accomplishing
these aims are of exceptionally high significance for unraveling the fundamental biology of Treg with regards to
memory and antigen-specificity, as well as establishing the scientific framework to explain epidemiological
features of human pregnancy complications and shifts in autoimmune disease severity after parturition.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circulatory system consists of endothelial cell-lined blood vessels that serve as a transport network for red blood cells, which carry oxygen, immune cells, and hormones of the endocrine system. In parallel, the lymphatic system comprises blind-ended vessels, which are similarly lined by endothelial cells and are closely associated with the blood vessels of the circulatory system. Lymphatic vessels collect and return interstitial fluid to the circulatory system, are a site of lymphoid cell development and transit, and are required for lipid absorption in the digestive system. In both systems, the primary cell type that initiates formation and mediates function is the endothelial cell. Interestingly, lymphatic endothelial cells derive from venous endothelial cells during embryonic development indicating a common origin for both vessel types. Not surprisingly, a number of signaling molecules are shared and required for the formation of the circulatory and lymphatic systems. Among these is Flt4, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells that binds the ligand vascular endothelial growth factor c (Vegfc). Loss of Flt4 function in mouse or zebrafish embryos leads to a range of defects in veins, angiogenic blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels. This diverse requirement for Flt4 is governed, in part, by its highly dynamic expression during embryonic development. However, little is known about upstream regulators responsible for dynamic expression. An additional aspect of the dynamic role of Flt4 is its ability to activate a wide range of downstream signaling effectors in endothelial cells. Studies in primary cell lines and in vivo suggest that distinct downstream effectors may play context dependent roles during embryonic vascular and lymphatic development. Given the importance of new blood and lymphatic vessel growth in both human development and pathological settings, a better understanding of how Flt4 signals is highly relevant. In this application we will rely on our expertise using the zebrafish as a model to address these issues. In Aim 1, we will determine what controls dynamic expression of flt4. In particular, we will investigate the role of ERK and Ets transcription factors in directly activatin enhancers at the flt4 locus to induce tip cell expression. This will be achieved through application of transgenic and knockout zebrafish lines. In Aim 2, we will determine which Flt4-proximal signaling outputs are essential for vascular and lymphatic development. This will be done through application of site-specific nucleases to generate zebrafish lines bearing targeted deletion of tyrosines in the Flt4 cytoplasmic domain. Analysis of these lines will allow us to determine the importance of different downstream effectors in mediating context-dependent roles of Flt4.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
Project Background Veterans with amputation are an important population facing considerable physical, social, and emotional challenges that can impede their reintegration into the community. We define community reintegration as activities and participation across a range of life roles including Relationship with spouse/significant other; Parenting; Education; Work; Social; Leisure; Spiritual/Religious, Civic; Self Care; Domestic Life; and Economic Life. While the majority of Veterans with amputation enjoy full and productive lives in these areas, studies have documented increased rates of psychological distress and role limitation within this population. Medical devices (i.e., prostheses designed to maximize balance and mobility) and psychosocial interventions (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapies) offer opportunities to further enhance community reintegration. Unfortunately, a lack of systematic data on the community reintegration of Veterans with amputation, including associated physical and contextual factors, hampers our ability to most effectively design and target future devices and interventions. Project Objectives This project is a novel collaboration between a group of psychologist clinician investigators with expertise in reintegration, qualitative (survey) methodology and quantitative methods and an accomplished group of biomedical engineers with expertise in amputation, prostheses, and mHealth technology. The overall goal of this collaboration is to generate systematic information about the community reintegration outcomes of Veterans with amputation needed to advance the development or refinement of interventions and technologies aimed at improving reintegration outcomes. The specific aims for this pilot (SPiRE) proposal are: Specific Aim 1: To characterize community reintegration and its associated physical (i.e., amputation and medical comorbidity) and contextual (i.e., psychological, environmental, and medical device) factors. Specific Aim 2: To obtain a deeper understanding of Veterans' experience of community reintegration and discover potential barriers and facilitators of community reintegration among Veterans with amputation. Project Methods This is a mixed-methods investigation of Veterans with major lower limb amputation who have received services from the Minneapolis VA Regional Amputation Center (RAC). Aim 1 will utilize a mailed survey of 425 Veterans with amputation identified through a RAC database. The survey will assess community reintegration with validated measures of social and community participation that are normed within disability and general population samples. It will also include important correlates of reintegration including measures of psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety, body image), physical (e.g., prosthetic use, pain) and environmental (e.g., social support) factors related to reintegration. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the independent contribution of each variable over and above demographic factors. Aim 2 will be addressed using data from qualitative interviews with a subset of Veterans (n=24) with varying levels of community reintegration stratified by service era. In-depth interviews will explore Veterans' perspectives on reintegration; aids and supports; perceived barriers and facilitators; perceived needs for medical and psychosocial services; and interest in and use of medical technologies related to reintegration. A rapid turn- around qualitative analytic approach will be used to extrac and summarize key themes. Results will be used to inform the development of new technological (e.g., prostheses, mHealth applications) and psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting and enhancing Veteran community reintegration.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved
epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired neuronal network dynamics that can be targeted by non- invasive brain stimulation. In particular, rhythmic stimulation waveforms (transcranial alternating current stimulation, tACS) that enhance cortical synchronization may represent a targeted and therefore more effective approach to treat these network abnormalities. The long-term goal is to develop a new, noninvasive treatment for schizophrenia that is based on a mechanistic understanding of the network- level pathology. The overall objective of the R21 phase is to compare tACS and sham, with tDCS as a positive control for assay sensitivity, for treatment of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial. Additionally, the mechanism of action will be studied with electroencephalogram (EEG)-based biomarkers to elucidate the network- level effects of non-invasive brain stimulation. The objective of the R33 phase is to perform a double- blind, sham-controller clinical trial to assess the reduction in AHRS scores by five days of twice-daily tACS compared to sham stimulation (primary outcome) and the additional benefit of low-dose maintenance tACS (secondary outcome). The central hypothesis is that tACS is an effective treatment modality for auditory hallucinations and that the
effectiveness of tACS correlates with changes in neuronal synchronization measured by EEG. The hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (R21: 1) evaluate tACS for the treatment of medication resistant auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia, (R21: 2) elucidate the network-level mechanisms that are targeted by tACS and determine the predictive value of EEG synchronization measures for treatment outcome, and (R33: 3) perform a larger pilot clinical trial to assess tACS versus sham stimulation (primary outcome) and low-dose tACS maintenance treatment versus sham maintenance (secondary) outcome for reduction in AHRS scores. The significance of the proposed research is the chance of significant improvement in quality of life of affected patients with successfully treated medication resistant symptoms of schizophrenia, specifically auditory hallucinations.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the same sensory information, we generate different responses in different situations, depending on our goal, task rule, etc. This flexibilit is a hallmark of cognition and involves gated routing of information flow in the brain circuitry, the underlying mechanism remains largely mysterious. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to elucidate computational principles and circuit basis of gated computation and flexible sensori-motor mapping in decision-making. I propose that gating is accomplished by four complementary mechanisms: (a) tunable dendritic inhibition by a subclass of GABAergic neurons for input gating, (b) pathway-specific excitation-inhibition balance for processing in discrete stages, (c) top-down signaling from rule representation for network selection, (d) a STOP process for inhibitory control of automatic response. I will rigorously investigate these mechanisms in biologically based circuit models, in collaboration with experimentalists who are carrying out single-neuron physiological experiments in which monkeys perform flexible visuo-motor tasks. In a paradigmatic task of controlled action, the appropriate response to a sensory target is to either shift the gaze toward it (pro-saccade) or away from it (anti-saccade) depending on task context. In colored-target tasks, a perceptual decision about an ambiguous stimulus or a probabilistic inference based on sensory cues must be made, before the subject knows when and how the decision will be used to guide action selection. Our model will be tested by quantitatively reproducing single-neuron activity data as well as behavioral performance, and uncovering the underlying circuit mechanisms that will be testable in new experiments. In Aim 1, I will examine circuit mechanisms for gating, including input-specific dendritic inhibition and the idea of pathway-specific excitation-inhibition balance. Aim 2 will be
devoted to rule-based action selection, by developing a detailed circuit model of the pro-/anti-saccade task. In Aim 3, I will examine gated neural dynamics when perceptual decision and action selection are temporally separated. We will build spiking network models for versions of the random dot motion direction discrimination task and weather prediction task. The pro-/anti-saccade and colored-target visuo-motor tasks all depend on flexible routing of information from a sensory decision circuit to an action selection circuit, which confers a strong cohesiveness to this application. This research program will shed insights into complex dynamics of neurons endowed with mixed selectivity that underlie adaptive coding in flexible behavior.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adapting behavior and cognition to meet changing environmental demands is critical for optimizing wellbeing. Previous research has identified an important role for the neuromodulator dopamine, particularly with respect to its effects on the striatum, in regulating cognitive flexibility, that is, the ability to flexibly update the contentsof working memory and relevant goals. Variability in the striatal dopamine system has been associated with alterations in cognitive flexibility, and indeed, a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including attentional deficit disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction are characterized by abnormalities in both dopaminergic neurotransmission and cognitive control. Importantly, both appetitive and aversive motivation are thought to phasically increase and decrease, respectively, the release of dopamine into the striatum, thus raising the possibility that motivational context may differentially impact cognitive control processes. Recent
work has demonstrated that reward motivation increases cognitive flexibility, but only in individuals with higher baseline levels of striatal dopamine. Research examining the impact of aversive motivation on cognitive control has been much more limited; in one study, threat of punishment was associated with reduced updating of working memory content, suggesting that aversive motivation may bias individuals away from cognitive flexibility and toward cognitive stability. However, to date, no work has explicitly examined the role of baseline dopamine system function in mediating the influence of aversive motivation on cognitive control processes or the frontostriatal circuitry that supports them. By exploiting genetic variants known to impact the striatal dopamine system, and using a targeted psychopharmacological intervention, the proposed fMRI experiment seeks to fill this gap by examining the effect of striatal dopamine variability on patterns of brain activation and cognitive flexibility in the face of aversive motivation. A second aim of the proposed research is to characterize the role of the habenula in moderating the impact of an aversive motivational context on cognitive control processes. The habenula is a small region of the epithalamus that has recently been implicated in inhibiting striatal DA release in response to potential punishment; if inhibition of striatal DA resulting fro aversive motivation impacts the frontostriatal circuitry supporting cognitive flexibility, the habenula may provide a critical linkage between motivation and cognitive control. Together, the proposed research will expand our knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to individual differences in the relation between motivation and cognition. Further, results of this work may inform our understanding of cognitive control abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant DA neurotransmission and of the impact of both therapeutic and illicit drug use on aspects of cognitive control.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, in response to PAR 10-038, will evaluate of an implementation model that engages high school students in Wellness Council planning to achieve obesity-related health recommendations. The implementation planning will apply a participatory action research approach to empower students as stakeholders and to facilitate collaborative planning by school Wellness Councils, facilitated and supported by the HealthCorps coordinators. To facilitate achievement of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines, we will implement a process to enable schools to select toolkit strategies and elements from evidence-based curricula (e.g., Physical Activity for Teenage Health (PATH), which includes implementation strategies using low-cost resources). The 2010 Dietary Guidelines obesity-related behavioral recommendations for youth include: decreasing sugary beverage intake; increasing frequency of breakfast; increasing vegetable and fruit intake to 2 1/2 cups per day with fill half your plate with fruit and veggies educational message; decreasing frequency of fast food meals; becoming physically active (goal of 1 hour per day); and reducing sedentary behavior time (<2 hour day). The social ecological framework provides the foundation for a two-tiered integrative approach which addresses barriers faced by the school (micro-environmental level) and by the students (individual level). At the school level, implementation barriers will be
identified by (or brought to) the school Wellness Councils (e.g., crowded gym, lack of equipment, food service issues) using a toolkit approach patterned after the Alliance for a Healthier Generation school toolkits. At the student level, the toolkit will focus on barriers to implementation of lifestyle changes. Options for the student toolkit include tailored student support via social media e.g., Facebook, text message or email to address common internal barriers, such as self-efficacy and motivation, and external barriers in the home, school and community environment. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to roll out testing of the participatory implementation model, we will randomly select from among the NYC HealthCorps high schools each year. This design will allow us to assess the impact of wellness programming on students, in relation to their school environment. To evaluate how our participatory implementation model addresses wellness barriers in diverse, complex school settings, we will employ system dynamics modeling (SDM). This method will synthesize both quantitative and qualitative assessment results into simulation output that will show the process by which wellness programming is adapted and sustained over the intervention period. We hypothesize that students in the participatory implementation schools will achieve better dietary and physical activity health habits than students in waitlisted HealthCorps control schools. Secondary hypothesis, students will achieve key health behaviors after their NYC HealthCorps school is randomized to participatory implementation compared to students in the waitlisted HealthCorps control schools; Tertiary hypothesis: Using system dynamics modeling to evaluate implementation will facilitate more robust dissemination. The simulation analysis will apply the RE-AIM framework: (Reach (participation rates), effectiveness (outcomes), adoption (acceptability), implementation (intervention fidelity), and maintenance (sustainability of lifestye changes by students and programs by schools).]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite that causes debilitating and sometimes life- threatening disease during pregnancy and in immunocompromised individuals, including those with AIDS. Toxoplasmosis is the second most common cause of death by foodborne illness in the USA and costs the economy billions of dollars annually. T. gondii is also a valuable experimental model for related apicomplexan parasites, including those that cause malaria and cryptosporidiosis. Host cell invasion is essential to the parasite's life cycle, and apical membrane antigen1 (AMA1) is a highly conserved transmembrane protein on the parasite surface that plays an important role in invasion. Much is known about how the extracellular domain of AMA1 interacts with its ligand on the host cell surface (RON2) during invasion, but surprisingly little is known about the function o its short, C-terminal tail, which is located in the parasite cytosol. The central hypothesis of thi project is that the cytosolic tail of T. gondii AMA1 (TgAMA1) functions in invasion-related signaling pathways, through interaction with other parasite proteins. The Aims of the project are to: (a) Determine the phenotypic consequences of specific mutations in the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail, establishing  at what step(s) in invasion the cytosolic tail functions and the specific resides involved; (b) Identify and determine the biological function of proteins that interact with the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail,  establishing whether tail mutations that disrupt invasion also affect the binding of specific proteins; and (c) Determine whether the binding of TgAMA1 to TgRON2 triggers intracellular signaling mediated by the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail, resulting in invasion-related changes to the parasite phosphoproteome. These studies address a significant gap in our understanding of the role that AMA1 plays in the invasion of host cells by apicomplexan parasites. A more complete understanding of AMA1 function will generate new approaches to preventing or controlling the devastating diseases caused by this important group of human pathogens.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) affects about 5 million Americans and more Medicare dollars are spent for the diagnosis and treatment of HF than for any other diagnosis. Because ATP is absolutely required to fuel normal contractile function, metabolic strategies to treat HF are an appealing investigative treatment strategy. This application focuses on augmenting depressed metabolism in HF by over-expressing the genes for specific isoforms of creatine kinase, the primary myocardial energy reserve reaction. In the failing heart there is reduced CK activity and a decrease in the myofibrillar (CK-M) and mitochondrial (CK-mito) isoforms. CK-M over-expression in murine HF, induced by thoracic aortic constriction (TAC), was recently shown to significantly improve left ventricular systolic function at rest and with stress and to increase survival, suggesting a critical role for CK energy metabolism in failing hearts. Conversely, even more recent studies suggest that depleting creatine, a substrate for the CK reaction, had no adverse effect on contractile function and survival in the myocardial infarction (MI) model of HF, suggesting no pathophysiologic role for creatine or CK in HF. This application aims to resolve this apparent controversy and to shed new, important insights into the role of CK and creatine in HF. The underlying hypothesis is that dysfunctional, viable myocytes benefit from CK over-expression but models with dense necrosis and cell loss do not. The studies will compare different HF models with and without dense necrosis during separate genetic manipulation of CK expression and creatine content. The proposal will exploit recently created cardiac-specific CK-mito over-expressing mice and noninvasive, serial magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging technology to assess the in vivo energetic, contractile, remodeling, and survival consequences in murine HF. The proposed studies aim to answer these timely questions and identify the mechanisms responsible for potential benefit with promise of reducing HF morbidity and mortality.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
We propose a randomized, controlled trial of a telephone-based, brief insomnia treatment in primary care in order to accomplish the goal of improving psychosocial functioning in post-deployment Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans who meet criteria for Insomnia Disorder. The primary outcome for the trial will be psychosocial functioning, with insomnia severity serving as the secondary outcome. Additional goals include evaluating durability of treatment gains and obtaining feedback from participants about the utility and feasibility of the proposed insomnia treatment.  One hundred Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with Insomnia Disorder will be randomly assigned to either Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI; one 60-minute and one 30-minute in-person encounter, and two 20-minute phone-based encounters) or a Progressive Muscle Relaxation Training control group (manualized relaxation training delivered by two in-person and two phone sessions, matched to the BBTI condition for therapist time). Prior to randomization, participants will complete clinician-administered, mental health diagnostic interviews at baseline (and post-treatment). Psychosocial functioning, insomnia severity, and other related self-report measures will be completed at baseline (pre-treatment), mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up (active treatment group only). Sleep parameters (e.g., sleep diaries, rest activity) will be completed with a sleep diary mobile application and the Basis wristband (Basis Science Inc., San Francisco) and associated mobile application that tracks sleep cycles and sleep and waking movement, which will be provided for each participant. One week of sleep parameters data will be collected at baseline as well as post-treatment (and at 6-month follow-up for active treatment group only). Both groups will also collect sleep parameters data during the four-week intervention period.  We will conduct post-treatment evaluations with the experimental group to help determine the utility of BBTI as well as how the intervention may be improved for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. Veterans who received BBTI will complete a feedback questionnaire that will inquire about various aspects of the treatment. The goal is that 75% of Veterans will report that the treatment is feasible and acceptable in various domains, as measured by a rating of three or higher on a five-point Likert scale. Veterans who complete BBTI also will be asked to participate in a 30-minute feedback interview reviewing ratings of each of the domains, as well as most and least helpful aspects of the treatment, data which will be audio recorded and coded. These post- treatment interviews with Veterans will yield suggestions on how the treatment can best be improved for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans and be implemented in primary care settings. Trained coders will be asked to categorize areas identified by Veterans as helpful and areas noted as needing improvement until no new categories are identified (e.g., thematic saturation). These suggestions will be systematized and used to prepare the treatment for implementation with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans in primary care. This trial will provide useful information regarding rehabilitative outcomes, and it will yield specific information that will allow us to modify BBTI, ensuring a tailored product based on Veteran feedback.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dyslipidemia and the oxidative stress associated with it are among the main risk factors leading to atherothrombosis. Platelet activation plays a key role in atherothrombosis and the subsequent acute coronary syndromes triggered by plaque rupture. Many dyslipidemia- related pathophysiological states are associated with a drastically increased response of platelets to agonists. While the significance of increased platelet reactivity in the pathophysiology of occlusive arterial thrombosis is widely recognized, knowledge of molecular mechanisms leading to enhanced platelet reactivity in vivo during hyperlipidemia has only started to emerge. Involvement of platelet pattern recognition receptors in platelet function has been recently appreciated. We have previously demonstrated that the platelet scavenger receptor CD36 serves as the platelet sensor for oxidative stress and promotes platelet hyperreactivity in dyslipidemia. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that TLRs, another family of pattern recognition receptors with previously unknown role in platelets, can regulate platelet function. Our recent data demonstrate that platelet TLR1/TLR2 and TLR9, alone or in collaboration with CD36, recognize novel altered-self ligands that accumulate in the circulation during oxidative stress and dyslipidemia. Ligation of these receptors activates pathways common to the innate immunity system, and connects this signaling to the integrin activation network in platelets via links that have not yet been established. Generation of biologically-active oxidized lipids and related products is a critical consequence of oxidative stress. According to our studies these molecules represent altered self ligands for platelet pattern recognition receptors. We have previously identified a novel family of oxidized choline glycerophospholipids (oxPCCD36) that serve as high affinity ligands for CD36 and promote platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis in vivo via CD36. Our recent studies extended this observation to a novel class of products formed via degradation of oxPCCD36 by PLA2. We showed that carboxyalkylpyrrole adducts of proteins and phosphatidylethanolamine are novel ligands for platelet TLRs, are powerful platelet agonists and accumulate in vivo in dyslipidemia. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of receptor recognition, the contribution to thrombosis in vivo of novel ligands and the signaling pathways they induce in platelets are not known. This proposal will address the hypothesis that platelet TLRs, alone or in cooperation with CD36, promote platelet reactivity and the prothrombotic state induced by endogenous ligands generated during oxidative stress.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the importance of mast cells (MCs) in innate and acquired immunity, their development and recruitment into the skin is not well understood. Our findings suggest that the skin microbiome has a strong influence on migrating and, in particular, maturing MCs in the skin. Based on our preliminary data, we have demonstrated that bacterial products at the skin surface participate in the regulation of MC antimicrobial functions,
homing to the skin, and help them respond to their survival growth factor, SCF. Even more important is the ability of the microbiome to induce an anti-inflammatory phenotype on human MCs that contributes to maintaining skin homeostasis, which helps avoid unnecessary inflammation. Antibiotic exposure, and a pseudo-aseptic environment, have the potential to alter the skin microbiome selectively and may be the cause of the increasing incidence of human disorders such as atopic dermatitis. We hypothesize that bacterial products, increase mast cell recruitment and are responsible for maintaining high levels of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and a low pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. A humanized mouse model system will enable the simultaneous study of both human MC migration pathways and TLR innate immune responses in a genetically adaptable organism, thereby translating our findings to human skin. We propose the following: a) Determine whether bacterial products from the skin microbiome are required for normal mast cell localization and function. The use of germ free and antibiotic treated mice will allow us to test whether disruption of the normal skin microbiome results in improper localization and function in vivo and whether reconstituting the microbiome can reverse these effects. Because human MCs may have a different sensitivity to the microbiome, we will test our findings on human MCs (huMCs) to provide a foundation for future translational research. b) Clarify the signaling pathways that are responsible for MC sensing the skin microbiome and how activation of these pathways affects MC function. We will focus on characterizing the MC receptors involved in sensing bacterial byproducts. The aspects to be studied: 1. Commensal activity directly on MC receptors (TLR ligands), 2. Commensal activity on keratinocytes that generate ligands (SCF, IL-1, and S1P) for MC receptors, and 3. Commensal activity on Endothelial cells (SCF) that generate ligands for MC receptors. c) Determine how MC interaction with the microbiome modulates intracellular pathways in skin MCs and affects their function. Our preliminary data show that bacterial byproducts modulate huMCs maturation and activation through NF-kB, S1P and intracellular sphingokinases (Sphks) pathways to produce S1P; we have found that LTA and other commensal fractions induce the expression of specific miRNAs that interfere with TLR-NF-kB signaling.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunization rates for recommended childhood vaccines have consistently been high, with childhood series completion near 80% by 19-35 months. However, these high immunization coverage rates do not fully account for delays or refusals of early childhood (i.e., less than one year of age) vaccine uptake. Overall, the proportion of children not receiving all recommended vaccines or whose parents are consistently limiting visit-level vaccine administration is increasing. Children who do not receive
all recommended vaccines are at greater risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, which can lead to development of severe sequelae, hospitalizations, and death. Additionally, despite evidence showing the effect of vaccinating pregnant women in reducing disease among infants too young to be fully vaccinated, maternal immunization rates remain low. We developed and pilot tested a novel, innovative, evidence based, and comprehensive immunization intervention at the Practice, Provider, and Patient (P3) levels to meet the diverse and complex information needs of mothers. This P3 intervention included components such as use of practice-level vaccine champions, expanded reminder-recall systems, and provision of practice-level immunization rate feedback (practice-level interventions); physician peer-delivered training related to vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination recommendations, and vaccination system logistics, as well as standardized talking points for use when recommendation vaccination (provider-level interventions); and an interactive tablet computer (iPad) education application for pregnant women to view while waiting for care (patient-level intervention). Our pilot testing found this P3 intervention to be well received by providers and patients and indicated a few areas where the intervention could be improved. In the proposed project, we will develop and evaluate an improved version of the P3 intervention, to be called P3+. Improvements to the initial P3 framework will be based on findings from the original evaluation project as well as additional formative research. We will then evaluate the P3+ intervention in a geographically and socio-demographically diverse set of obstetrician- gynecologist offices in Georgia (community-level practices) and Colorado (offices of the Kaiser Permanente Colorado managed care organization). The research will be led by Multiple PIs who have extensive experienced in understanding and addressing barriers to vaccine uptake. The proposed evaluation will address vaccine uptake both for pregnant women and for their children, through 24 months of age, to test the hypothesis that increasing acceptability of vaccines during pregnancy will lead to positive changes in acceptance of vaccines for children.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and patients who survive a coronary artery occlusion have a high risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Spatial heterogeneity of sympathetic transmission is a major contributor to post-infarct arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction (MI), and sympathetic denervation predicted arrhythmia risk in recent human studies.  We have identified two distinct types of sympathetic denervation after MI: 1) persistent denervation of the infarct/scar and adjacent border zone myocytes, and 2) transient denervation of uninjured peri-infarct myocardium. This proposal will develop methods to prevent or reverse both types of denervation, and determine if restoring sympathetic innervation throughout the ventricle decreases arrhythmia susceptibility. The infarct remains denervated after MI due to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). We identified protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTP?as the major CSPG receptor in sympathetic neurons, and found that removing PTP?esulted in reinnervation of the border zone and hyperinnervation of the cardiac scar. Preliminary data suggest that eliminating PTP?ormalizes cardiac electrophysiology and renders hearts surprisingly resistant to post-MI arrhythmias. This suggests that restoring sympathetic innervation has a beneficial effect on arrhythmia susceptibility. However, it's not clear if re-innervation is the key to preventing arrhythmias, or if other actions of PTP?ontribut to decreased arrhythmia susceptibility in PTP?- hearts. We hypothesize that the major action of PTP?s to prevent reinnervation via interactions with CSPGs (Aim 1), and that restoring sympathetic innervation will decrease arrhythmia susceptibility (Aim 2). Peri-infarct myocardium is transiently denervated 1 and 3 days after MI and loss of sympathetic fibers outside the infarct requires activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor. We identified ProNGF and a form of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (either proBDNF or BDNF) as p75 ligands that are elevated in the heart after MI. We will test the hypothesis that pro-neurotrophins and/or BDNF stimulate peri-infarct denervation, and that preventing peri- infarct denervation will decrease arrhythmia susceptibility (Aim 3).  We have assembled an outstanding team of experts along with unique animal models and novel genetic tools to assist us in completing these studies. This work will test directly if manipulating cardiac nerves after MI can normalize cardiac electrophysiology and decrease arrhythmia frequency, opening a new avenue for therapeutic development.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus infections have a major impact on human health and the threat of pandemic infections remains imminent. Antibody inducing Influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines are available, however protection is suboptimal and requires annual reformulation of the vaccine. IAV can escape neutralization by preexisting antibodies due to the high rate of mutation in the primary targets of neutralization (hemagglutinin, HA and neuraminidase, NA) and due to its capacity to recombine in non-human hosts. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, memory CD8 T-cell specific for epitopes located in conserved regions of IAV proteins like the internal components nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase A and matrix protein can confer protection. Recent human challenge studies and longitudinal analyses during the 2009 H1N1 IAV pandemic support the notion that cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells are capable of ameliorating disease when pre-existing antibodies are absent. As most humans carry a small number of these broadly protective memory CD8 T-cells, increasing the number of these cells through boosting is an attractive strategy to bolster their protective capacity. However, memory CD8 T-cells constitute a very heterogeneous population and little is known about how boosting or multiple antigen exposures effects CD8 T-cell mediated protection against IAV, For instance, we have recently reported that the type of booster agent significantly affects the localization and protective capacity of the resulting memory CD8 T-cell population (Sl?tter et al, 2013). Therefore, our long-term goal is to determine optimal memory CD8 T-cell characteristics for protection against IAV and to understand how such memory populations can be generated. In turn, these studies will provide crucial information to optimize broadly protective vaccines for
IAV. Specific Aim 1.  Determine the molecular mechanisms regulating CXCR3 expression in memory CD8 T  cells to enhance airway localization.  Specific Aim 2. Determine the impact of repetitive IAV infections on the generation of airway---surveilling, tissue resident and circulatin memory CD8 T cells and their relative contribution in protection from IAV.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified a region of chromosome 9p21 as the most important source of heritable cardiovascular risk. This locus is independent of traditional risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, suggesting it potentiates disease via a novel mechanism. The most predictive 9p21 variants account for more than 20% of an individual's lifetime risk for coronary artery disease. Despite being implicated in the leading cause of death in the Western world, the mechanism(s) by which these polymorphisms lead to vascular disease remain unclear.  In this proposal, the investigators seek to elucidate the relationship between a leading candidate gene at the 9p21 risk locus, CDKN2B, and vascular disease. Specifically, they will query the role of this gene in angiogenesis, and the concept that CDKN2B may regulate disease via a paradoxical and antagonistic effect on blood vessel sprouting, and blood vessel maturation. This proposal will bring together recognized experts from several fields, deeply phenotyped human tissue samples and unique mouse models with the objective of fully describing the vascular biology of CDKN2B. This application includes three specific aims which will: 1) Map the molecular mechanism by which CDKN2B regulates blood vessel stabilization; 2) Employ novel cell-specific Cdkn2b knockout animals to specifically determine which cell type regulates the pathologic response to ischemia, and whether the process is reversible; and 3) Determine whether the angiogenic defect also promotes atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and myocardial infarction in human carriers of the 9p21 risk allele. The objective of these studies is to 'reverse translate' the biology of the 9p21 locus and contribute to the field of cardiovascular genetics in the post-GWAS era. Discoveries made in the course of this proposal are intended to support the stated mission of the National Institutes of Health and provide contributions that will
lead to the development of new translational therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Clinical Translation Core (CTC) provides investigators with a set of services to enhance the
productivity of Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) clinical translational researchers. The CTC
focuses on the effective and rapid collection of IDD study populations that are of adequate size and well-
characterized. IDDs are highly variable disorders that result from heterogeneous genetic factors which affect
brain function in a non-uniform manner. Scientific progress demands that each IDD be well characterized and
stratified along more than one dimension in order to control for a degree of clinical heterogeneity that otherwise
could confound progress in developing therapies. The CTC addresses this challenge by providing a host of
approaches to enable recruitment of very large samples that are well-characterized across relevant
dimensions. These supports include (a) Creating new websites for individual projects that will serve as both a
recruitment portal and as a mechanism to enable online IRB consent and collection of ?light phenotyping?
through use of a common IDD library of questionnaires; (b) Mining the CHOP/Penn electronic health record
for recruitment and for study data; (c) Creation of a shared IDD database that is common to all IDDs
investigated at our institutions. This shared database will facilitate secondary analyses that discriminate clinical
features specific to a particular IDD; and (d) The coordination of the many existing clinical translational
resources at CHOP/UPenn, in order to carry out the CTC's aims in the most cost effective manner, and amplify
its effectiveness. The CTC also provides expert consultation with (a) gold standard clinician administered
assessments, as well as (b) deep phenotyping via a host of novel, technology based approaches for
quantifying behavior (e.g., eye tracking, motion capture, use of on online computer adaptive tests). In addition
to these crucial supportive roles, the CTC will foster new clinical investigation by creating an infrastructure
that will be available to future investigators, which will simplify their entr&#233;e to high-quality human research.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: Then CTC is of fundamental importance to the mission of the IDDRC as it
facilitates interdisciplinary and translational research in IDD. It is a vital component of the CHOP/UPenn
Center's goal of advancing the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and amelioration of IDDs. The CTC helps
bridge all three domains of the organizing theme of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC (see Overall: Overview of Center):
?Genes, Brain, and Behavior?. By centrally focusing on quantifying behavior, as well as facilitation of biosample
collection, it is integral the process of successfully understanding and treating the biological bases of the
behavioral manifestations of IDD.
Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to approved
users at other Centers in the Network.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Neuroimaging and Neurocircuitry Core (NNC) enables the study of changes in brain circuitry
which occur in people with IDD. The Core supports research in both patients and animal models by providing
users the following state-of-the-art technologies: (a) Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of brain
activity; (b) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of brain structure and function; (c) Multiphoton,
confocal, and epifluorescence microscopic imaging studies of the dynamics of neuronal circuit function; (d)
Patch clamp recording studies in neurons; and (e) Electroencephalographic (EEG) and other in vivo
recordings. Analyses are performed in affected human patients with IDD, in Preclinical animal models of IDD,
and in vitro (stem cells and tissue culture). Core Directors provide users with access to a wide set of otherwise
inaccessible neuronal circuit assessment techniques, as well as expert consultation regarding experimental
design and analysis. In all core functions, emphasis is placed upon quality control. In addition to assuring that
all studies are competently conducted and appropriately analyzed, the Core Directors assist users to design
studies that are properly controlled, adequately powered, and, when feasible, conducted in a blinded fashion.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The overarching theme of this IDDRC is ?Genes, Brain & Behavior? (see
Overview). This Core focuses on each of these overlapping domains. Genetic alterations underlie many IDDs,
and result in aberrant protein expression, which alters basic brain function. This in turn generates the
behavioral anomalies which constitute IDD. The study of patients and animal models brings the genetic
components into sharp focus, and the NNC facilitates examination into how these genetic changes alter brain
function and, subsequently, whether such changes are correlated to behavior. Thus, the goal of the Core is to
quantify the changes in function of neuronal circuits which result from genetic mutation and variation.
Elucidating the changes in dynamic function of neuronal circuitry responsible for the generation of the
pathologic behaviors collectively termed the IDD is critical in translational efforts to develop better therapies to
treat and cure brain pathologies underlying the IDDs and other related CNS disorders such as autism,
epilepsy, and cerebral palsy.
Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to users at
other Centers in the Network.

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activity-regulated modulation of synapse function lies at the heart of molecular theories of learning and neural development, and is disrupted by diseases and disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder. In glutamatergic synapses, multi-domain proteins establish the core of the postsynaptic density (PSD), the structure which links neurotransmitter receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and to intracellular signaling pathways. Though the structures of PSDs and synapses are known to change dramatically in diverse paradigms of synaptic plasticity, it is not known to what extent structure alone-rather than molecular content such as receptor number-can control synaptic strength. We have developed tools to address this. Thus, in cultured neurons from rat hippocampus, we will use single-molecule imaging approaches along with electrophysiology and new molecular tools to tackle this central question of synapse biology. First, we will follow up on intriguing work from our prior funding period indicating that scaffold molecules in the PSD are distributed with substantial peaks and valleys of density across the PSD parallel to the membrane. We hypothesize that these peaks establish a similar organization of other proteins at points that stretch from the presynaptic terminal too deep into the spine, and particularly that PSD structure guides protein organization within the active zone, thus assuring the optimal alignment of vesicle fusion apparatus with clustered postsynaptic receptors. Second, we ask whether PSD substructure-rather than its overall size-regulates receptor activation and thus synaptic strength. We test this using new techniques to monitor postsynaptic NMDAR or AMPAR activation during concurrent super-resolution imaging to measure postsynaptic structure. Third, using a newly developed method, we analyze for the first time the distribution of vesicle release sites within single active zones. For these aims, we test the role of the key scaffolding molecule Shank in maintaining transsynaptic structural organization, both to test fundamental mechanisms and because its failure to do so may contribute significantly to human disease. The answers to these questions provide a new and detailed view of how synaptic function arises from its notoriously detailed architecture. Perhaps most importantly, they will provide an important platform on which to test hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of disorders that disrupt synaptic transmission.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

The candidate has completed research and clinical fellowships that prepared her for an academic career studying perinatal social epidemiology and is currently a full-time faculty member in the Department of Neonatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The candidate is a core member of the Division of Newborn Medicine at Harvard Medical School serving as an Instructor in pediatrics, which is the standard entry level academic position at Harvard. This K23 award will provide her with the structure and support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) assess the role that arsenic plays in fetal growth; (2) assess the role arsenic plays in the DNA methylation of genes involved in fetal growth such as inflammatory cytokine genes and the glucocorticoid receptor gene, and explore whether arsenic affects fetal growth through such epigenetic mechanisms; (3) gain expertise in environmental toxicology and environmental epigenetic analyses; and (4) learn the administrative skills needed to manage a large cohort study so that transition to an independent research career running her own birth cohort is accomplished. The candidate's goal is to examine the role the toxic chemical environment plays in birth outcome disparities in the US. To achieve these goals, Dr. Burris has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Robert Wright, MD MPH, Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Environmental Health who is an expert in pediatric environmental health and toxicology, and co-mentor Andrea Baccarelli, MD PhD, the Mark and Catherine Winkler Associate Professor of Environmental Epigenetics, who has expertise in epigenetic analyses. Although chemicals like arsenic are known to affect birth outcomes and known to affect DNA methylation, it remains unknown whether DNA methylation mediates arsenic-birth weight associations. The study proposed is designed to test the hypothesis that arsenic impairs fetal growth, that arsenic causes alterations in the DNA methylation of inflammatory cytokine genes and the glucocorticoid receptor gene. The candidate will explore whether DNA methylation disturbances mediate arsenic-birth weight associations. These analyses will be performed within a previously established, currently funded cohort in Mexico City (ELEMENT) directed by Dr. Wright. The candidate will use the abundant resources available at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the Harvard Catalyst (Clinical and Translational Science Center) and the Harvard School of Public Health to obtain the training and coursework necessary to supplement the practical training attained through these analyses to become an independent investigator with a research program studying the environmental impact on birth outcome disparities.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal looks at the importance of viral diversity on transmission and evolution. Viruses exist not as clonal populations but as 'swarms' of variants with mutations along the genome. Variation has not been characterised in arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses), which require infection of a vertebrate host and a vector (such as a mosquito or tick). During infection of the mosquito there are several anatomical barriers that reduce the number of viral particles, thus a bottleneck is imposed on the virus. It i hypothesised that, upon infection of the mosquito vector, the amount of variation decreases, leading to a decreased rate of evolution in the arboviruses as compared to viruses with a single host. The rate of evolution is important to understand viral ecology and emergence. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and two natural mosquito vectors will be used to model viral variation present in wild-type transmission, and the impact that mosquito infection has on viral diversity. VEEV is of interest because it is both an important, naturally emerging virus and a potential bioweapon with no licensed vaccine or therapy. The virus circulates in Mexico and has caused outbreaks in equids and humans in the U.S. Viral diversity will be investigated using 3 specific aims. First, the bottleneck profile of the epidemic vector Psorophora confinnis will be determined compared to the bottleneck profile already determined for the enzootic vector Culex taeniopus. Secondly, the profile of intra-host variation of VEEV subtypes IE and IC will be determined upon infection of the mosquito vectors C. taeniopus and Aedes taeniorhynchus and an appropriate rodent host, individually and as part of a transmission cycle. The effect of the anatomical mosquito bottlenecks on viral diversity will be investigated using an established protocol to initiate a laboratory transmission cycle that approximates to that occurring naturally.
The levels of diversity will be determined using Next Generation Sequencing technology to determine the minority populations present throughout the transmission cycle. This decrease in diversity may lead to a reduction in fitness due to stochastic effects. The level of drift caused b this decrease in diversity will be tested via an experimental transmission cycle. Thirdly, the change in the ability of the virus to complete a transmission cycle when the polymerase fidelity is increased by genetic manipulation will be examined. It is hypothesized that viral variation aids
in viral survival therefore viruses mutated to exhibit high-fidelity in their replication will be ued in experimental infections. It is expected that viral survival will decrease. The results of this projct will enhance our understanding of arboviral population genetic dynamics occurring in the mosquito vector as well as determine the degree to which natural selection and genetic drift influence the persistence and emergence of new arboviruses. The results will translate to other emerging arboviruses such as dengue, West Nile and chikungunya, as well as provide the data to generate effective models of arbovirus emergence.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[?   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria engage in multiple fundamental processes including biogenesis, fission/fusion, mitophagy, and cell death - in addition to their role as ATP generators in the cell. These processes are complex, and for this reason, have been largely studied in isolation. Yet, it is clear that they overlap substantially at the molecula level, functionally, and with respect to their roles in disease. In this application, we propose experiments that bi-directionally connect Bax, a central mediator of cardiomyocyte death, with Parkin, an important activator of mitophagy in cardiomyocytes. Using genetic manipulations, we have found unexpectedly that endogenous levels of Bax in healthy cells suppress mitophagy. We have observed this in adult cardiomyocytes in vitro and in the heart in vivo. We postulate that this is a physiological mechanism that restrains inappropriate or excessive elimination of mitochondria, a situation that would be deleterious to cardiomyocytes, which are highly dependent on ATP. We will elucidate the mechanism, which may involve an interaction between Bax and Parkin, and test the functional significance in vitro and in vivo. The fact that Bax and Parkin interact raises the reciprocal question: What might Parkin be doing to Bax in the heart? Previous work in non-cardiac systems has shown that Parkin inhibits Bax translocation to mitochondria during cell death, but the mechanism has not been elucidated. Parkin is known to inhibit cardiomyocyte death in vitro, and deletion of Parkin in vivo markedly exacerbates post-infarct remodeling, heart failure, and mortality. These effects have been assumed to be mediated solely through Parkin-stimulated mitophagy. Given the directness of the connection between Bax and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and necrosis, however, we challenge that view and hypothesize that Parkin protects the heart primarily through its inhibition of Bax. We will test ths hypothesis and delineate the molecular mechanism by which Parkin inhibits Bax. Accordingly, the over-arching hypothesis of this project is that Bax and Parkin antagonize each other for the benefit of cardiomyocytes: The binding of Bax, likely in its cell death-inactive conformation, to Parkin inhibits Parkin-mediated mitophagy to prevent mitochondrial depletion. Conversely, the Bax-Parkin interaction inhibits Bax, likely through interfering with its transition to its active conformation, thereby inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and necrosis. This is an MPI application that brings together the expertise of Richard Kitsis (cardiomyocyte death) and Gerald Dorn (cardiac mitophagy). This research is highly significant as it will stimulate the field
to consider and investigate connections between individual mitochondrial processes, such as cell death and mitophagy. In addition, it will lead to a reconsideration of the primary mechanism by which Parkin protects the heart. The work is also highly innovative because most of the concepts and relationships have not been previously considered. Through this research, we will achieve a better understanding of the pathogenesis of acute cardiac injury during ischemia/reperfusion and post-infarct remodeling.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is based on the observation that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is overexpressed within allografts in association with ischemia-reperfusion, humoral immunity and acute and chronic rejection. Current paradigms suggest that it functions as a dominant factor mediating vascular remodeling, especially in association with chronic inflammation. However, VEGF also has potent proinflammatory effects in association with cell-mediated immune inflammation. The novelty of this research proposal relates to recent observations that the VEGF receptors (VEGFR) KDR (VEGFR2), Flt-1 (VEGFR1) and neuropilin family molecules are expressed on populations of effector, memory and FOXP3high T regulatory cells. Further, our ongoing observations indicate that VEGF-KDR interactions are potent to mediate motility and activation responses within T effector cells. Nevertheless, it is not known if VEGF may interact with all T cell subsets, or whether it mediates different responses in different VEGFR-expressing T cells. In this R01, we plan to question the interplay between VEGF and Class 3 semaphorins, and how these molecules interact with their common neuropilin receptors expressed on T effector and T regulatory cells in the alloimmune response. Since VEGF is thought to compete with class 3 semaphorins for binding to the neuropilins, these observations beg the question whether VEGF binding may alter Sema3-inducible inhibitory/regulatory immune responses. Our hypothesis is that intragraft VEGF interacts with circulating VEGFR-expressing T cells, and that individual VEGFRs on T cell subsets elicit signals that either promote or suppress migratory and activation responses. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims in which we will 1), determine the expression and function of VEGFRs in T cell subsets, and evaluate the interplay between VEGF and class 3 semaphorins for T cell chemotaxis, activation and immunoregulatory responses, and 2), determine the effect of VEGF-neuropilin-semaphorin interactions in vivo in physiological models of allograft rejection. Our proposed studies address novel and clinically relevant questions and our approach provides for cohesiveness to translate in vitro findings into clinically relevant models in vivo. Collectively, the implications and clinical relevance of this area of investigation is that local intragraft VEGF, which is traditionally thought to serve simply as an angiogenesis factor, may be a novel factor that coordinates interactions among circulating VEGFR-expressing T effector and T regulatory cells within the graft.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angioplasty and stenting for peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the femoropopliteal artery segment, consisting of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal artery (PA), carries the highest rate of reconstruction failure primarily because it undergoes large deformations during flexion of the limb. Our preliminary data demonstrate that previously published limb-induced deformations of the SFA and PA are markedly underestimated, and that certain stent designs are not able to accommodate these severe deformations. We propose to precisely quantify the mechanical environments of the SFA and PA in order to determine the optimal patient and lesion- specific stent for the SFA and PA. This will be accomplished through 3 Specific Aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine the 3D bending, torsion and compression of the SFA and PA as a result of limb flexion in human cadavers using our new intra-arterial marker technique, CTA, and image analysis. In Aim 2 we will determine the biaxial mechanical properties of SFA and PA from human tissue donors with PAD, along with the mechanical properties of 5 commonly used self-expanding nitinol PAD stents. In Aim 3 we will use the data on femoropopliteal artery flexions (Aim 1) and SFA, PA and PAD stent mechanical properties (Aim 2), to build a computational model of the stented SFA and PA. This model will then be subjected to limb flexion induced deformations to determine the mechanical stress resulting from the interaction of the stent with the artery. A comparison of each of the 5 stents under identical conditions, including a systematic study of the effects of age, diabetes and lesion calcification on these mechanical stresses, will allow identification of the optimal stet for the SFA and PA in patients with different clinical and lesion characteristics. The capability o our model to predict areas where restenosis will occur in the stented SFA/PA will for the first time be clinically validated in PAD patients by comparing the areas of high stress in the patient-specific models to the areas of restenosis visualized by CTA 6 months after stenting. The ability to rationally select patient and lesion-specific stents for the SFA and PA will produce more durable reconstructions and have an immediate direct translational impact benefiting PAD patients with claudication and critical limb ischemia. Our precise description of the human SFA and PA mechanical environments will greatly advance our knowledge of PAD pathophysiology and will allow the development of a better stent for the SFA and PA. By creating vital, currently unavailable computational model input data and taking the initial steps towards clinical validation, our study will serve as a foundation for larger-scale, more cost-effective in silico comparative effectiveness studies of current and future PAD stents and help advance the new paradigm of patient-specific modeling and medicine.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Effectiveness of second line hypoglycemic medications among veterans Guidelines recommend metformin as the initial treatment for diabetes mellitus (DM) unless contraindicated, and also recommend a treatment target glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of <7%. Many patients require a second agent to reach these goals; however, little guidance is given for the selection of a second agent. Clinical judgement must be utilized and HbA1c goals of less than 7% may not be appropriate for some patients, particularly elderly patients and those with cardiovascular disease (CVD). While randomized trials often generate efficacy data, some trials do not include long-term outcomes; have a narrow spectrum of patients and may not compare relevant exposures to each other. Observational studies can help fill knowledge gaps and include diverse populations. This proposal will focus on real world decisions faced by clinicians and patients. We propose to answer key questions. Among patients using a single agent for the care of their diabetes and whose HbA1C is above goal on metformin monotherapy: What is the impact of insulin initiation compared to initiation of a second oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) on glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes? Among the subgroup of patients with pre-existing heart disease, what is the impact of no intensification versus intensification with any agent on the risk for cardiovascular and renal outcomes? This project will utilize national VHA data (Corporate Data Warehouse- Vital Signs File; pharmacy, SAS Medical datasets, VIReC Medicare data and VHA Vital status files) and National Death Index data to construct a national cohort of veterans with DM initially treated with metformin for a new diagnosis of DM (inception cohort). The proposed study follows this inception cohort to determine the patterns of drug use at the time they fail first line therapy (HbA1c >7.0% while on metformin). Given that metformin is recommended as first line therapy among many patients, we will study the addition of drugs to metformin to determine which regimen is most beneficial to risk intermediate outcomes such as HbA1C and long term outcomes such as CVD and renal outcomes. Persons included are aged >18 years, utilize the VA healthcare system between 10/30/2000 to 09/30/2010. The following exposures will be examined: 0= no DM drug, 1= metformin only, 2= metformin + insulin, 3= metformin + sulfonylurea 4= metformin+ pioglitazone 5=metformin+ rosiglitazone and 6= none of the above. Aim 1 will examine patient characteristics at the time of therapy initiation. Examined attributes will include administrative covariates plus those collected through chart review (Frailty index, diet, exercise, metformin adherence, and patient/provider information about treatment choice, and co-morbidities). We will use this information to help construct cohorts with similar covariates. Additionally, sensitivity analyses will quantify the size of a confounder that would explain our study findings. Aim 2 will examine glycemic effects of the second agent: the proportion who reach HbA1c of <7% and mean difference in HbA1c at 1 year as well as durability of glycemic control among those who have a second agent added and adverse effects including serious hypoglycemia. Aim 3 will examine the time to clinical outcomes including CVD (AMI, Stroke), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and all cause and cardiovascular mortality. We will use the marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models (MSM) using stabilized Inverse probability treatment weights (IPTW). The IPTW will be modeled using multinomial logistic regression incorporating fixed (baseline) and time-dependent exposures and covariates. The final stabilized weights used in the proposed MSMs will be calculated as the product of the treatment and censoring weights given each patient's static and time varying covariates over the previous time-points. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to determine the effect of unmeasured confounders on risk of the outcome. The research team is poised to conduct a rigorous study on the safety and clinical effectiveness of second line therapies for DM.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

Objectives: The major goal of the proposed study is to evaluate alcohol outcomes among mid-late life veterans with a history of Alcohol Dependence (AD), and in so doing, to better understand differences in the course of alcoholism over the lifecourse, the predictors of successful remission, and the value of alternative treatment interventions for those veterans least likely to obtain conventional treatment. Our work over the past four years and the emergent findings described in this application provide the foundation for our project's next phase. Aim 1: To examine history of AD and other predictors of drinking and drinking-related outcomes in late life. Aim 2: To extend our work on the course of drinking to incorporate information on change and stability of problem drinking from mid to late life. Aim 3: To control for genetic influences in assessing events and conditions that may be most beneficial to target in existing or future evidence-based treatments. Aim 4: To identify barriers that keep mid-late life drinkers from seeking treatment and the types of nonconventional interventions that the veteran may be more likely to engage. Research Plan/ Methodology: The Principal Investigator's (PI's) current Merit Review project has assessed an unusual sample of veterans (1774 total, 841 with a lifetime history of AD) obtained from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry (VETR). An extensive assessment of this sample was conducted in 2001 when veterans averaged 50 years of age. Combining this data with materials from previous VETR-based studies (of these same veterans) allows for longitudinal assessments of drinking over the life course and identification of predictors of remission and relapse. This renewal application builds upon and extends this work as these veterans transition from midlife to later life (the 2011 assessment; average age=60 years) where we focus on (1) change and stability of problem drinking during mid to later life, (2) predicting late-life outcomes from various individual, interpersonal and contextual influences, and (3) identifying barriers to treatment and alternative approaches that will enhance treatment of veterans with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Clinical Relevance: Given the large and increasing number of mid-late life veterans with AUD (over 350,000 veterans with AUD seen in the VA in 2008), it is essential that we achieve a better understating of alcoholism and comorbid disorders over the life course in order to develop more effective strategies for reducing the severity and persistence of alcoholism. The proposed study is aimed at providing this knowledge. Findings or Conclusions to Date: Notable findings: (1) the identification of 4 distinct drinking trajectories over the life course (severe chronic, severe nonchronic, young adult and late onset); (2) the identification of personality characteristics , coping strategies and earlier psychiatric disorders that are predictive of transitions from first drink to first AD episode and years from first AD episode to first remission; and (3) obtaining important validly data on the retrospective LDH procedure demonstrating correspondence between retrospective and prospective reports regarding key drinking measures.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poxviruses are highly unusual among DNA viruses in replicating solely within the cytoplasm of the infected cell. This physical autonomy from the nucleus is accompanied by genetic complexity: ~200 viral gene products regulate diverse aspects of the viral life cycle. Despite this genetic autonomy, the close relationship between cell
biological processes and the progression of the viral life cycle is increasingly clear. Nowhere is this interplay more evident than during the morphogenesis of nascent virions in the cytoplasm. The biogenesis of the poxvirus membrane is one of the most intriguing and puzzling questions in the field. Genetic analyses have identified the F10 protein kinase, and the A6, A11, A30.5, H7 and L2 regulatory proteins as essential mediators of crescent biogenesis. In their absence, membrane diversion and crescent formation are defective, but little is known about how they coordinate and induce membrane egress from the ER. Likewise, when the major membrane proteins A14 or A17 are repressed, crescents do not form, but large numbers of ~25 nm vesicles accumulate in the cytoplasm. Thus, they are essential for the shaping, stability and elongation of nascent membranes. Their role in mediating these processes remains unknown.  Our long-term goal is to fully understand poxviral membrane biogenesis. Our current objectives are to identify host proteins that enable the assembly and egress of viral ER exit sites, to understand the mechanism by which the viral regulatory proteins mediate this process, and to evaluate the dynamic interaction of A14 and A17 with membranes. We will accomplish these objectives by using genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to pursue three complementary Aims. Aim I: Analysis of the role of host proteins and membrane trafficking systems in viral morphogenesis. We will identify and analyze host proteins that are either substrates of the F10 protein kinase, associated with viral membrane intermediates, or important for viral membrane biogenesis. Aim II: Analysis of the A6, A11, A30.5, H7 and L2 proteins and their contributions to crescent biogenesis. This aim is focused on characterizing the biochemical properties of these 5 regulatory proteins, assessing their interaction with each other, with membranes, and with host proteins, and gaining insight into how they direct and facilitate membrane biogenesis. Aim III: Assessment of the association of A14 and A17 with membranes in vivo and in vitro. Using a variety of innovative in vitro and in vivo techniques, we will probe the topology of these proteins within membranes and test the hypothesis that they mediate membrane tubulation or heterotypic fusion.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major public health concern in recent years has been increasing reports of adverse cardiac events, including sudden cardiac death (SCD) that have been associated with the use of non-cardiac drugs. Multiple non- cardiac drugs had to be withdrawn from the market after being linked to SCD due to abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), resulting in the loss of significant developmental costs. Therefore, it is critically important tha cardiac liability of therapeutic compounds be recognized early on. Unfortunately, there is currently no reliable, high throughput screening (HTS) method to test such compounds because most safety tests are performed either in non-cardiac cells, non-human cardiac myocytes, or complex and costly animal preparations. Recent advances utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells to derive human cardiac myocytes (hCM) have revolutionized the investigation of cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms. Moreover, fluorescent indicators of cellular function provide for a wide array of electrophysiological metrics to assess arrhythmia liability. These developments provide a very unique opportunity to develop a novel HTS platform for testing drug induced arrhythmia. However, limitations associated with electrical stimulation of excitable cells significantly hamper
such development. Recently, we have made it possible to use pulsed infrared (IR) light to stimulate excitable tissue. There are numerous features of IR light stimulation that are very advantageous for HTS, especially when combined with fluorescent measurements of cardiac myocyte function. Such a fully optical HTS platform does not currently exist and, thus, this proposal represents a significant innovation. However, it is unknown if IR light stimulation in hCM monolayers is robust enough for an HTS platform. Technical issues associated stimulation efficiency, interference with fluorescent measurements, spatial specificity to perform accurate measurements in small wells (for HTS capabilities) remain a question. In addition, the physiological and pathophysiological response of hCM monolayers to IR light stimulation is unknown. Our objective is to create a contactless, fully optical, HTS platform for testing drug induced arrhythmias. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Develop, optimize, and determine the robustness of IR light stimulation in hCM monolayers, with specific regard to stimulation and damage metrics, and 2) Determine the physiological response of hCM monolayers with IR light stimulation compared to electrical stimulation (gold standard) and compared to the whole heart. Our ultimate goal is to develop a new approach that is desperately needed for cardiac safety screening. This would have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry, FDA, and the research community.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION:    
Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) are often progressive and frequently represent the most debilitating symptom that result in decreased functional outcome and quality of life (QoL). It is estimated that 20-50% of individuals with PD meet criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI), which is characterized as the transitional phase between normal cognition and dementia. Unfortunately, there are few pharmacologic treatment options to help with cognitive impairments associated with PD-MCI. Cognitive rehabilitation based on the development of compensatory strategies represents a non-pharmacological approach to improve cognition in PD-MCI. However, to our knowledge there are no studies examining this approach in PD, which is a critical gap in our knowledge. Moreover, neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. sleep difficulty, mood), common in PD, are often neglected in traditional interventions. Thus, the overall aim of this investigation is to determine the efficacy of a novel, manualized compensatory cognitive rehabilitation program to improve cognitive deficits as well as improve neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life/health status (QoL/HS) in individuals with PD-MCI. This program, Cognitive Symptom Management and Rehabilitation Therapy for Parkinson's Disease (CogSMART-PD), is a 10-week intervention that provides cognitive skills training and teaches compensatory strategies to help individuals with PD-MCI cope with and adapt to cognitive deficits. Also, the program provides psychosocial and stress-reducing techniques to attenuate common neuropsychiatric symptoms that often negatively impact cognitive functioning and QoL. Our preliminary data demonstrated that CogSMART-PD holds great promise for the treatment of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD-MCI. To our knowledge, this is the first proposed randomized, parallel, controlled study to investigate the efficacy of a compensatory cognitive rehabilitation program adapted specifically for PD. We hypothesize that cognitive functioning, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life/health status will improve in
PD-MCI participants following 10 weeks of the CogSMART-PD, and these improvements will be maintained at 6- and 12-months post-treatment. One hundred ten participants with PD-MCI based on the criteria set forth by the Movement Disorder Society will be recruited for this study. Over-recruitment by 20% will be instituted to account for subject attrition or unusable data. Participants will be randomized into either a 10-week CogSMART-PD intervention group (n = 55) or 10-week supportive care group (n = 55). All participants will be assessed with a battery of tests that measure objective and subjective cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, disease severity, motor symptoms, and quality of life/health status by an examiner blinded to group assignment. Assessments will be administered at baseline, 10 weeks (post-treatment), and 6- and 12- months (follow-ups). Data will be primarily analyzed using analyses of covariance and linear random effects modeling. Results of this study will provide essential information about a non-pharmacological intervention for individuals with PD-MCI that could improve their cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life/ health status. Moreover, these results may demonstrate the first evidence of preventing or stabilizing functional cognitive decline in PD and could provide a manualized and systematic program that can be feasibly implemented and disseminated throughout the VA Healthcare System.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensive glucose control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with clear health benefits. However, maintaining near-normal glycemia remains an elusive goal for most patients, in large part owing to the risk of low glucose levels (hypoglycemia). T1DM patients are susceptible to hypoglycemia due to defective counterregulatory responses (CR) characterized by: 1) deficient glucagon release during impending hypoglycemia; 2) additional hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and exercise-associated autonomic failure (EAAF) that blunt the sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycemia following repeated episodes of hypoglycemia or exercise as well as degrading other CR; and 3) hypoglycemia unawareness, lowering the threshold for symptoms that trigger behavioral responses (e.g. eating). Thus, the risk of hypoglycemia in T1DM impedes ideal insulin treatment and leads to suboptimal glycemic control. Our lab has explored a new approach of enhancing CR by translating mechanisms responsible for HAAF/EAAF into potential therapeutics to modulate the CR to hypoglycemia. We have previously demonstrated that HAAF can be prevented in T1DM patients by opioid receptor blockade. Since adrenergic activation has also a modulatory effect on hypoglycemia CR, we thus hypothesize that a common mechanism linking opioidergic and adrenergic systems is responsible for the development of HAAF and EAAF. Our specific aims are to 1. Examine whether activation of &#191;-opioid receptors, and/or adrenergic receptors, regulate HAAF in humans, 2. Establish the components of the adrenergic response responsible for modulating HAAF/EAAF and their association with the opioidergic system, and 3. Perform a preliminary clinical trial to examine the
efficacy of chronic opioid receptor blockade in preventing HAAF in patients with T1DM. Correction or improvement of hypoglycemia counterregulation and restoring hypoglycemia awareness in patients with T1DM would represent an enormous step forward in the management of these patients, including preventing morbidities or death.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanisms involved in Ehrlichia chaffeensis internalization, establishment of intracellular infection, persistence, and subversion of antimicrobial defenses are not well understood, but appear to be dependent on secreted ehrlichial effector proteins. E. chaffeensis utilizes T1S to export tandem repeat protein (TRP) effectors that escape the ehrlichial vacuole through an unknown mechanism. TRP47 and TRP120 are highly antigenic proteins that we recently determined interact with a diverse array of host proteins including, but not limited to, post translational modification ligases and epigenetic regulators. PCGF5, a component of the polycomb-repressive complex (PRC) involved in epigenetic regulation of Hox genes, strongly interacts with these TRP effectors. We have determined that polycomb group (PcG) proteins are recruited to ehrlichial vacuole and are differentially degraded. Moreover, consistent with PcG protein degradation, the PRC1- mediated H2AK119ub repressive histone mark is significantly decreased, while PRC2-mediated mark H3K27me3 is downregulated in a gene-specific manner. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate E. chaffeensis modulates PRC controlled Hox genes through TRP-mediated degradation of PcG proteins, thereby modulating associated repressive epigenetic histone modifications. Through this investigation we will establish the mechanism by which E. chaffeensis exploits an evolutionarily conserved group of epigenetic regulators to establish a cell type-specific gene expression program that promotes intracellular survival. In the first aim, we will examine changes in PcG proteins during E. chaffeensis infection and associated epigenetic histone marks, determine molecular TRP interactions involved in PcG recruitment to the vacuole, and characterize components of PcG-protein complexes in normal and infected contexts to determine TRP induced changes. In the second aim, expression of PcG regulated Hox genes will be examined during E. chaffeensis infection by microarray, the role of specific PcG isoforms in regulating Hox gene expression during infection and survival will be examined using iRNA, and epigenetic marks will be investigated on target genes to determine the role of TRP-PcG mediated regulation. The exploitation of PcG transcriptional regulation in mononuclear phagocytes by a bacterial pathogen is novel, for which E. chaffeensis represents a model system to investigate this complex pathogen-host interaction. This investigation will define the targets and mechanisms of TRP-mediated transcriptional reprogramming strategies, and determine the roles of PcG and epigenetic marks in modulating host gene expression in order to create a cell type-specific prosurvival program. Characterization of the host cell pathways modulated by ehrlichial effectors and the molecular mechanisms involved will expand our understanding of the general principles that underlie the cell biology of infection and surviva strategies utilized by intracellular microbes. This knowledge is necessary to identify novel host targets for therapeutics based on mechanistically defined host-pathogen interactions potentially utilized by a wide range of microbes.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium parasites cause the disease malaria, which kills close to one million people per year. The disease is formidable, due to the spread of drug-resistant parasite strains, insecticide-resistant mosquito vectors and the inherent difficultis in the implementation and maintenance of effective control programs. Today, emerging resistance to artemisinin combination therapy, which is the standard drug treatment for uncomplicated malaria, poses a significant threat to malaria control. Understanding the genetic basis of antimalarial drug resistance is key and will inform development of new interventions. Experimental crosses between malaria parasite strains are the most powerful way to determine the genetic determinants of phenotypes, and importantly, have been successfully used to determine the genetic basis of P. falciparum drug resistance in the past. To date however, only three P. falciparum experimental crosses have been carried out due to the enormous practical and financial hurdles associated with the process, which cannot be performed in humans, and thus used splenectomized chimpanzees. The genetic analysis of recombinant progeny from a well-conceived cross can be extremely powerful for pinpointing the genetic loci determining a phenotypic trait and has important advantages over population genetic studies. Given the recent decision by the NIH to cease the use of chimpanzees in biomedical research, experimental crosses will no longer be available, effectively rendering future forward genetic studies impossible.  However, we have recently shown that a mouse harboring human hepatocytes (the FRG KO huHep mouse) infused with human red blood cells can support P. falciparum sporozoite infection, complete liver stage development as well as the transition to asexual blood stage replication. We hypothesize that the FRG KO huHep mouse can be utilized successfully for routine and robust P. falciparum experimental crosses, thereby replacing the previously essential chimpanzee host. We have data to show that we are able to perform experimental genetic crosses utilizing this model and the crosses generated independent recombinant progeny that we will use for analysis of recombination as well as genotypes and associated phenotypes. Furthermore, we have also carried out an experimental cross with a recent field isolate resistant to artemisinin, allowing us to study the basis of artemisinin resistance. Combined with rapidly improving technologies, such as parasite genetic manipulation, high throughput phenotyping and Systems Genetics, a powerful model for malaria genetic research is now within reach.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[Project Summary:
The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that TGF-&#223;1 released from platelets and activated by shear
stress in the circulation contributes to the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis (AS) and the complications
associated with implantation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in heart failure (HF) patients. This will build
upon our previous and new preliminary studies demonstrating that: 1) shear force can activate latent TGF-&#223;1,
2) thiol-disulfide exchange contributes to the activation process, 3) mice deficient in platelet TGF-&#223;1 are
protected from developing cardiac fibrosis in response to pressure overload, 4) Reversa mice develop AS and
increased plasma TGF-&#223;1 levels that correlate with shear stress, and 4) both AS and LVAD-implanted HF
patients have increased levels of TGF-&#223;1 compared to controls. We will extend our findings by integrating data
from biochemical analyses, animal models, and human patient studies. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that
shear activates TGF-&#223;1 by facilitating thiol-disulfide exchange involving TGF-&#223;1, thiol isomerases, and/or other
thiol-containing proteins, such as TSP1 and vWf. Purification of TGF-&#223;1 and other thiol-containing proteins
from platelets, proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry, and mutational studies of recombinant proteins
will be employed to identify the shear-induced thiol-disulfide exchange responsible for TGF-&#223;1 activation. Aim
2 will test the hypothesis that TGF-&#223;1 is released from platelets and subsequently activated by high shear in
vivo using two mouse models: a surgically-induced Ascending Aorta Constriction model to acutely simulate
high shear, and a Reversa mouse model that spontaneously develops AS and high shear across the aortic
valve. We will assess TGF-&#223;1 release and activation as well as the impact on TGF-&#223;1 activation in mice with a
mutation in the latency-associated protein (LAPC33S), whose TGF-&#223;1 cannot be activated by shear and in mice
selectively deficient in platelet PDI (PDIflox). Reversa mice have increased levels of TGF-&#223;1 that correlates
with shear stress. We will test the role of platelet TGF-&#223;1 and PDI on AS progression by breeding Reversa
mice with platelet-specific PF4Cre/Tgfb1flox and PF4Cre/PDIflox mice. A TGF-&#223;1 neutralizing antibody will be
used to monitor AS progression as a model for intervention. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that release and
activation of TGF-&#223;1 occurs in vivo by assessment of TGF-&#223;1 levels in AS and LVAD-implanted HF patients.
AS patients have elevated TGF-&#223;1 levels compared to controls. TGF-&#223;1 levels will be correlated with AS valve
pathophysiology. Whether TGF-&#223;1 levels are decreased after valve replacement surgery will be assessed.
TGF-&#223;1 levels are elevated in LVAD-implanted HF patients and associated with the loss of vWf multimers. We
will monitor TGF-&#223;1 levels through heart transplantation and correlate with vWf multimers to establish TGF-&#223;1
and vWf-multimers as surrogate markers for the risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage, respectively. Collectively,
these studies will illuminate and guide development of potential interventions to prevent AS progression as well
as diagnostic tools to detect early complications in post-LVAD implantation HF patients.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral inhibition/social reticence (BI/RET) is one of the most stable dispositional characteristics reported in childhood. Early BI/RET is often reinforced and exacerbated by children's reciprocal interactions with parents across development. Importantly, stable BI/RET places young children at subsequent risk for diagnosable anxiety disorders (namely, social phobia) during adolescence and adulthood and this risk is moderated by (a) overly directive/controlling parenting and (b) the child' lack of socal and emotion-regulation skills. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct and evaluate a full-scale, randomized controlled trial during which we will randomly assign 150 45-60 month old children and their parents to either the Turtle Program (combined adapted Parent Child Interaction Therapy and Social Skills Facilitated Play (PCIT and SSFP) or to a less intensive, 6-session parent psychoeducation group, the best available treatment for preschool BI. The Turtle Program components highlight the development of skills to intervene in the reciprocal cycle of parent-child and peer interactions that contribute to the development of anxiety. Importantly, the group- based nature of SSFP provides a social context in which parents can practice behavioral skills with their child while being coached by the therapists. This trial will examine mediators an moderators of treatment response. Outcome measures (collected at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and one-year follow-up) will include parent and teacher ratings/questionnaires of child anxiety symptoms/disorders, temperament, and social functioning; observational measures of parenting and children's social behaviors in the classroom; and heart rate physiology (a biological index of emotional reactivity and regulation).]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interleukin-1 family members are key inflammatory cytokines in the innate immune response to infection. While IL-1 is necessary for proper defense against pathogens, the production of this cytokine must be carefully regulated in order to prevent immunopathology. One checkpoint on the release of IL-1 family cytokines is their requirement for post-translational processing by a multi-protein complex known as the inflammasome, which serves as a platform for recruiting and activating the protease caspase-1. Sensing of extracellular bacteria by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers the transcription of il1b mRNA, but IL-1&#223; is not released until inflammasome sensor proteins recognize bacterial products that have entered the cellular cytosolic compartment. Type I interferons (IFN-I) are known to inhibit inflammasome activity, which partially explains their long-recognized immunosuppressive capacity, although the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. Induction of the enzyme Ch25h, which produces 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) from cholesterol, is a key component of IFN-I- mediated inhibition of inflammasomes. Ch25h is an IFN-I-stimulated gene in macrophages, and deletion of Ch25h results in increased capase-1 activity and release of IL-1&#223;. 25-HC is a potent suppressor of the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein (SREBP) cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and Ch25h-deficient macrophages additionally display increased SREBP pathway activity after TLR stimulation. Deletion of SCAP, a protein required for SREBP activation, in macrophages results in decreased inflammasome activity. Based on these data, I aim to characterize how the SREBP pathway positively regulates inflammasomes. Specifically, I propose to determine the necessity and sufficiency of SREBP proteins in augmenting inflammasome function, and to define which step of inflammasome activation they regulate (Aim 1). I also propose to test the hypothesis that SREBPs promote inflammasome function via the production of cholesterol (Aim 2).]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
Project Summary/Abstract We are excited to observe significant differences in the GPR109A levels in the white blood cells (macrophages) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and control individuals. Moreover, we observed similar changes in the GPR109A expressions in the substantia nigra regions that co-localize with the microglia of the PD patients and age-matched controls. We are the first lab to denote these changes. GPR109A is an anti- inflammatory receptor and niacin acts on it. Niacin is an anti-inflammatory agent and it is known to halt inflammation via GPR109A and nuclear factor-&#191;B (NFkB) pathway.  Niacin is known to block the translocation of NFKB to nucleus and thus reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will study these effects of niacin in PD patients by analyzing inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients. It has been documented that PD patients who are on carbidopa treatment have decreased levels of niacin. We have found significant reduction in the niacin index (NAD/NADP ratio) in PD patients compared to age- matched controls, denoting reduced NAD levels and increased oxidative stress. We propose a novel hypothesis that by reducing inflammation, niacin treatment will restore niacin levels along with GPR109A levels and will help improve motor coordination and cognition performances in the PD patients. Specific Aims: The two specific aims of the current proposal are as follows: Aim 1 A: To determine whether niacin supplementation will improve the symptoms of PD patients as correlated by performances in motor coordination and cognitive tests. Aim 1 B: To determine whether up-regulation of GPR109A in PD patients will respond to niacin therapy in reducing inflammatory markers in the CSF. Aim 2: To study the molecular mechanisms related to GPR109A as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic target in in-vitro models.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is an emerging tick-borne zoonosis caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech), an obligatory intracellular bacterium. The essential virulence factor of Ech is its entry into human monocytes through the route permissive for its replication. To advance our basic understanding and permit development of new therapies, our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate Ech infectious entry. Our recent study revealed that Ech uses EtpE (Entry triggering protein of Ehrlichia), a unique surface-exposed outer membrane protein to engage the human cell surface glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-anchored protein DNase X, which induces its entry into host cells to establish prolific infection. How EtpE binding to DNase X triggers infectious Ech entry is unknown. Our preliminary data revealed CD147, hnRNP-K, and N-WASP interact with the EtpE-DNase X complex. Thus, our hypothesis is that EtpE-DNase X binding anchors and activates N- WASP via CD147 and hnRNP-K to elicit spatio-temporal actin polymerization that drives Ech entry. In this application, we will pursue two aims to understand how EtpE binding to DNase X drives infectious Ech entry. Specific Aim 1 is to identify the EtpE-interacting host proteins and their mechanistic contributions to EtpE- triggered Ech entry and infection. We will analyze 1) whether CD147 and hnRNP-K are required for EtpE- coated bead entry, and Ech entry and infection of host cells and mice including use of mice with conditional Cre/LoxP CD147 knock-out in macrophages; 2) the spatio-temporal recruitment profiles of CD147 and hnRNP- K at entry foci of Ech and of EtpE-coated beads, by live-cell/intravital fluorescence microscopy; 3) proteins involved in the EtpE-host protein interaction, using a) tandem affinity purification and b subtractive multidimensional protein identification technology; 4) the determinants/kinetics of the
binding of CD147 and hnRNP-K to the EtpE-C-DNase X complex, by fluorescence resonance transfer, in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and in vitro binding assays, using defined domains and mutant proteins; and 5) monocyte tropism using human neutrophils and a granulocyte-tropic obligatory intracellular bacterium. Specific Aim 2 is to elucidate mechanisms to coordinate the spatio-temporal N-WASP activation at Ech entry foci. We will analyze 1) recruitment of N-WASP at entry foci of Ech and of EtpE-coated beads in a DNase X, CD147, and hnRNP-K-dependent manner; 2) requirement of N-WASP for entry of Ech and EtpE-coated beads, and infection of host cells and mice including the use of conditional Cre/LoxP N-WASP knock-out in macrophages; 3) requirement of DNase X, CD147, hnRNP-K, and N-WASP for EtpE-triggered polymerization of pyrenyl-actin in vitro; and 4) the spatio-temporal recruitment profiles of N-WASP and F-actin to entry foci of Ech and EtpE- coated beads, using live-cell imaging. If our hypothesis is proven, EtpE would be the first bacterial molecule described to activate N-WASP through a unique protein complex for infectious entry. The identified pathways will provide a platform for developing new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against Ech.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will investigate the dynamics and limitations of contextual adaptation in neurons that encode subjective value. Deficits in economic decision-making characterize a wide range of psychiatric and neurological disorders. The source of these deficits is difficult to determine, in great part because the neural mechanisms behind economic choice remain poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in economic choice, and particularly in the computation of subjective value. Studies in macaques have identified distinct groups of OFC neurons that encode information about the subjective value of options and outcomes during economic choice. Furthermore, the responses of these neurons appear to adapt depending on the context of the choice. Specifically, these neurons appear to adjust their tuning so that their maximum firing rate always maps to the maximum value the animal has recently seen. In light of these observations, several key questions remain to be addressed. First, while changes in the maximum value trigger adaptation, it is unclear whether changes in the minimum have any effect. The answer to this question could explain known behavioral phenomenon, such as the principle of diminishing marginal utility. Second, it is unclear how quickly value-adaptatio can occur. A slow rate of adaptation could limit subjects' abilities to make decisions effectively n rapidly changing environments. Third, it is unclear whether value-adaptation requires experience of extreme values, or if it can be triggered by abstract information about the values in an environment. If adaptation can be induced by symbolic cues, it would suggest that memory and semantic knowledge can directly manipulate neural representations of subjective value to influence economic choice. I will address these questions in the proposed experiments. I will record from single neurons OFC of macaque monkeys as they choose between juice options, periodically changing the context throughout the session. With the data I obtain, I will determine whether neural responses are affected by changes in the minimum value, measure the rate of adaptation in value-encoding cells, and test whether contextual cues are can induce adaptation before an animal is exposed to extreme values. The results from this project will provide important insight about the flexibility of value representations in the brain. This information wil fill important gaps in our understanding of economic choice circuitry and may ultimately guide the development of more effective treatment options impaired decision-making in patient populations.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysregulation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) turnover or function may contribute to the excess atherosclerosis in individuals with insulin-resistant (type 2) diabetes and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are characterized by low HDL. However, it is unknown how insulin regulates HDL in normal physiology, or in the pathophysiology of diabetes. FoxO1 is an insulin-repressible transcription factor that has emerged as a key mediator of insulin signaling in liver and the vessel wall. We have determined that FoxO1 regulates multiple genes critical for HDL metabolism and function, and mice lacking hepatic FoxO1 have alterations in HDL lipid and protein content. Thus, we propose that FoxO1 links insulin signaling and HDL. In Aim 1, we will investigate the hypothesis that FoxO1 regulates selective uptake of HDL-cholesterol in liver. We present preliminary data that FoxO1 regulates multiple steps in this process. In Aim 2, we will investigate the hypothesis that hepatic
FoxO1 regulates macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport. We will determine the roles of individual HDL genes in the FoxO1 phenotype, and determine the effects on atherosclerosis. In Aim 3, we will investigate the hypothesis that FoxO1 regulates vasoprotective functions of HDL. We will examine the roles of FoxO1-regulated HDL components in endothelial barrier function and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity. This work will build on novel hypotheses and a key mouse model to bring insight into the dysregulation of HDL during insulin resistance. The proposed studies will shed light on a key unanswered question in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, and reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Speedball (heroin/cocaine) addiction is a distressing public health concern for which there currently is no approved medication. Preclinical evidence suggests that 2 adrenergic agonists may reduce addiction-related effects of heroin and cocaine in laboratory animals, suggesting that they also may be particularly effective in attenuating effects of heroin/cocaine 'speedball' combinations. In response to PA 08-186, which calls for research to develop pharmacotherapies for polydrug addiction, we propose to evaluate the ability of 2 agonists to reduce the abuse- and relapse-related effects of speedball combinations in nonhuman translational models of drug addiction. First, drug discrimination and observational procedures will be used to establish proper temporal and dosing parameters for a series of novel 2 agonists that differ in 2 adrenoceptor selectivity and have favorable side-effect profiles compared to the FDA-approved drug clonidine. This information will guide our studies of how acute and chronic treatment with 2 agonists alters the reinforcing strength and intake of speedball combinations using a choice procedure that incorporates concurrently available second-order schedule of i.v. drug injection and food reinforcement. A major problem in drug addiction is that relapse in abstinent individuals can be triggered by a variety of stimuli including exposure to drugs, drug-related cues, or stressful events. To address this problem, separate studies will be conducted to determine how 2 agonists modify the ability of speedball injections, speedball-associated cues, or stressful stimuli to trigger drug- seeking behavior. Finally, chronic treatment studies with selected 2 adrenergic agonists will be conducted to determine whether tolerance occurs to the sedative or other observable side-effects of selected 2 agonists during repeated administration. We expect our research to identify 2 agonists that effectively attenuate the reinforcing effects of speedball self-administration and inhibit the impact of relapse-related triggers to drug-seeking. These findings will provide essential preclinical information to guide further development of 2 agonists as candidate pharmacotherapeutics for speedball addiction.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

The VHA has identified pain management as a high priority. Data document that perhaps a majority of Veterans receiving care in VHA, including OEF/OIF/OND [[and women]] Veterans, report the presence of pain.  CLBP, in particular, is among the most prevalent and costly of all disorders treated in VHA. Among the most promising therapies for reducing pain and improving functioning among persons with CLBP are low cost and low risk non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise and behavioral interventions. Despite evidence supporting their effectiveness, access barriers often prevent Veterans from receiving these interventions. A growing body of evidence suggests that behavioral interventions, including those for persons with CLBP, can be delivered successfully via the Internet. Development of a viable Internet-based delivery platform to facilitate Veteran access to such interventions for CLBP offers an important solution to several access barriers. Within VHA, the availability of MyHealtheVet offers an ideal platform for hosting a pain self-management intervention.   The primary objectives of the proposed study are to: (1) develop an integrative, Internet-based, Veteran-centered behavioral intervention, the Veteran Pain Management Resource Center (VPMRC) for CLBP, and (2) examine preliminary efficacy, usability, and satisfaction of this intervention in a representative sample of Veterans with CLBP. To achieve these objectives, a [[24-month]] pilot study with two phases is proposed. During Phase I, the VPMRC will be developed and feedback from 15 Veterans with CLBP and an Expert Panel of pain management clinicians will be used to modify the program. As currently envisioned, the  VPMRC will serve as a resource to help Veterans learn and practice adaptive behavioral and cognitive pain  coping skills such as relaxation and stress reduction methods, exercise and structured physical activity, and  activity pacing, among others. During Phase II, a pilot feasibility trial of the VPMRC will be conducted to test the preliminary efficacy and usability of, and satisfaction with the VPMRC. Fifty-five Veterans with CLBP will be recruited for Phase II. All participants will continue to receive their usual care from VHA providers. During [[the 10-week]] therapeutic window, weekly telephone calls from research staff will serve to cue and monitor participants' use of the Internet program. At [[ten]] weeks post-baseline, participants will be formally reassessed.   Planned statistical analyses will test the hypothesis that Veterans who engage in the VPMRC program will demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction in pain-related functional interference as measured by a 0.6 point decrease in individual scores on the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory-Interference Scale, relative to baseline. Additional analyses will test whether participants are more likely to report clinically meaningful reductions in pain intensity and improvements in fatigue, sleep, and mood, relative to baseline.  Participants are also hypothesized to report high levels of interest and credibility, use of, and satisfaction with the VPMRC. The Phase II quantitative outcomes data will further assist with modification and revision of the VPMRC. If the project is successful and demonstrates preliminary efficacy, further evaluation of efficacy via randomized controlled trial, followed by dissemination and implementation efforts, may increase access to pain self-management treatment and increase effectiveness of care for Veterans with CLBP.   
   
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    
Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is among the most prevalent and costly disorders among Veterans receiving care in VHA facilities. Behavioral interventions such as exercise and cognitive behavior therapy are known to be effective for CLBP but are often not readily available or easily accessed. The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop and test the preliminary efficacy and usability of and satisfaction with an integrative, Internet-based, behavioral pain self-management program, the Veterans Pain Management Resource Center (VPMRC), in Veterans with CLBP. The VPMRC will be designed and built to be compatible with MyHealtheVet (MHV). If successful, the long term objective is to migrate the VPMRC to the MHV platform to provide widespread and easy access for Veterans across VHA, regardless of geography or other access barriers.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vast majority of life, from bacteria to humans, evolved 24 h rhythms (circadian; from the latin circa - about - and diem - day) in genetic regulation, physiology and behavior. Stable circadian rhythms are critical for maintaining normal mental and physical health. In mammals (including humans), circadian rhythms are present in most tissues, but orchestrated by a master circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN does not oscillate at exactly 24 h, and is aligned to the Earth's rotation using light cues from the eye. Abnormal light cues (e.g., artificial light at night, time-zone changes, or irregular sleep patterns) perturb SCN rhythms, and desynchronize subordinate oscillating tissues system-wide. Acutely, these circadian disruptions cause discomfort and cognitive impairment until synchrony is reestablished. Chronic circadian disruptions (CCDs), (e.g., rotating shifts or frequent travel), however, can cause lasting impairments, including but not limited to: cancer, ulceration, heart disease, and depression in adults. The impact of circadian instability on more vulnerable, developing organisms is not known. Thus, given the relative sensitivity of development to perturbation, the present proposal explores whether CCD, early in life, has an enduring impact. My pilot data indicate that CCD during pregnancy and weaning adversely affects offspring morphology and adult behavior, providing impetus for empirical examination. It is possible that CCD negatively affects development by desynchronizing system-wide physiology in the developing organism, or through disharmony between offspring rhythms and those of their mother. It is also possible that CCD causes maternal stress, which is communicated to the fetus chemically and to the neonates behaviorally. Establishing the impact of CCD across early development, and disambiguating effects of physiological and behavioral disruption from those of maternal stress, will inform strategies for prevention and abrogation in pregnant mothers and young children. In the present proposal I will first examine the precise timing during which CCD exposure negatively impacts maternal care, offspring physical development, and offspring adult behavior to clarify the times of development most sensitive to early-life circadian disruptions. Next, to determine the specific contribution of maternal stress to observed deficits, I will explore the impact of CCD on maternal and offspring glucocorticoid - a key stress hormone - rhythms relative to rates of neurogenesis required for normal maternal care and offspring learning, and with epigenetic modifications known to regulate stress. Finally, I will employ strategies to 1) protect mothers from the negative
impact of circadian disruption by genetically protecting new neurons from glucocorticoids, and 2) rescue the rhythms of disrupted offspring with exercise, a treatment that also reduces stress and enhances neurogenesis. Together, these studies will clarify the specific developmental impact of circadian disruption, the mechanisms by which CCD negatively impacts development, and identify targets of opportunity for clinical interventions to reduce the impact of CCD in those
affected.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated sodium ion channels (Navs) are integral to both neuronal and muscular signaling and thus are critical to life. The abnormal expression of Navs can lead to a series of ailments including epilepsy, arrythmia, intractable acute and chronic pain, metastatic cancers, erythermalgia, and congenital insensitivity to pain. Despite their importance to human disease, a detailed understanding of the dynamic functionality of these voltage-sensing transmembrane pores continues to elude the scientific community. In order to develop an understanding of how Navs sense and respond to voltage change, we will use molecular probes to construct a model of the tertiary structure of the Site II binding pocket within the ion conduction pore.     
While there are nine known binding sites distributed around the nine known isoforms of the mammalian Nav, only Site II is within the ion conduction pore of the protein. Within a series of lipophilic alkaloid natural products known to be selective Site II ligands, veratridine is the most
efficacious agonist that is readily available from its natural source. Veratridine agonism of the Nav causes activation at normal resting potential, inhibition of inactivation, and reduction of bot single channel conductance and ion specificity. The behavior is extremely intriguing as Site II is located near the center of the conduction pore, however, veratridine ligation at that site profoundly effects the ion selectivity locus and the ion channel gate, both of which are located near the entrances to the pore many Angstroms away. A thorough explanation of how veratridine binding causes these changes will require an extremely detailed model of the veratridine binding pocket.     
In order to construct this model, ligand-protein complexes of veratridine and a series of related synthetic and semisynthetic molecular probes with a series of heterologously expressed point-mutated single isoform Navs will be characterized by whole-cell electrophysiology. These studies will be used to determine which functional groups on the natural product are essential for its biological activity as well as identify the residues within the ion pore of the Nav that ar integral for veratridine binding. The detailed understanding derived from these studies concerning how ligand binding at Site II deep within the ion pore of the Nav can have such a profound effect on the dynamic function of these transmembrane proteins could lead to the rational design of isoform-specific pharmaceuticals that would serve as treatment for a multitude of intractable diseases.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission. MG pathology is attributed to the presence of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies, which target the AChR at the neuromuscular junction. Many patients remain medically refractory or have intolerable adverse effects to current therapies; thus, another agent for the management of MG is needed. Several recent studies, including one performed by our group, have demonstrated the benefits of B cell depletion via rituximab treatment in MG patients. The NINDS-NeuroNEXT is conducting a multicenter randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase II clinical trial evaluating the therapeutic effect of rituximab for MG. We have exclusively partnered with this trial so that we can first, improve the understanding of the mechanism of action of B cell depletion in MG and second, so that fundamental questions regarding human autoimmunity can be addressed. Specimens prior to, during and after treatment are under collection for our work. This study presents a unique opportunity to study both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune diseases in which rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen-specific components that directly participate in the immunopathology of the disease. Our mechanistic studies will test the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying clinical benefit involves a reservoir of T cell-dependent, autoreactive memory B cells that supply a population of antibody secreting cells and is critical to MG autoantibody production. Rituximab eliminates this reservoir of memory B cells; then the newly formed B cell compartment is reshaped such that autoantibody production is diminished. To test this hypothesis, we have developed/applied assays to measure B cell tolerance defects, describe the repertoire of the B cell compartments and the B cell subsets that produce MG autoantibodies and characterize the antigen-specific T cells. This work will further our understanding of MG immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying the treatment of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases with rituximab. This proposal is directly relevant to the human disease and is in clear alignment and relevance to the mission of the NIH. That is, this translational research focuses on studying the human disease with human-derived cells. Furthermore, the importance of studying MG is magnified by its service as a model for antibody-mediated disease. Innovative, novel technology such as next generation sequencing and antigen-specific T cell assays will be applied to answer fundamental questions. The study is designed to elucidate the pathogenic role of major immunological components in MG, that is the contribution of B and T cells, including an investigation of fundamental autoimmune mechanisms, namely B cell tolerance and T cell pathogenic phenotypes. Through studying MG cell-mediated immunology we will further define the events that both initiate and propagate this disease that will provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of autoimmune disease.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This proposal describes experiments designed to understand the mechanisms involved in the control of recovery from bacterial infections. To recover from an infection and return to homeostasis, the host must activate mechanisms capable of controlling the damage caused by pathogen virulence factors, inflammation, and a potentially toxic antibiotic exposure. Failure to properly recover from infections manifests in the
form of recurrent infections, inappropriate wound healing, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders. The mechanisms involved in pathogen recognition and immune activation have been very well studied, but the cellular and systemic responses involved in recovery after an infection is cleared are not well defined. We have established a Caenorhabditis elegans model of acute infection and antibiotic treatment for studying biological changes during the resolution phase of an infection. We found that genes that are markers of innate immunity are downregulated upon recovery, while genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification, redox regulation, and cellular homeostasis are upregulated. Using gene expression profiling, in silico analysis, and reverse genetic approaches, we have linked to the control of recovery from infection to the function of conserved transcription factors, including th GATA transcription factor ELT-2, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, and the Nrf transcription factor SKN-1. The proposed experiments will explore the general hypothesis that neural GPCRs and cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act on non-neural tissues to regulate recovery from infection at the organismal level. Given the conserved nature of GPCR-mediated signaling and the conservation of the transcription factors involved in the control of recovery, the proposed studies should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms used by metazoans to control recovery from bacterial infection at the whole animal level.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>
